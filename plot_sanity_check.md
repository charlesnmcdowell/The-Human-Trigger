# The Human Trigger: Master Audit Checklist

Use this checklist for every chapter review.

### 1. Audio & Voice
- [ ] **Narrator:** Third Person Limited (Zero's POV). Cynical, noir-inflected narration.
- [ ] **Dialogue Tags:** Explicit tags ("Zero said," "Jax rumbled") for every speaker change.
- [ ] **Cast Consistency:** Ensure dialogue matches character archetypes (Zero=Witty/Dry, Cas=Fast/Transactional, Val=Cold/Military, Jax=Slow/Tectonic).
- [ ] **Dialogue Authority:** Permission granted to rewrite dialogue that feels "out of voice" or generic, even if it changes the specific phrasing. Prioritize character voice over literal instruction.

### 2. Style & Rhetoric
- [ ] **Rhetoric Scrub:** **ZERO** instances of "Not X, but Y" or "It didn't X; it Y." Reword as direct descriptions.
- [ ] **Jargon Hygiene:** Define capitalized terms (e.g., Sanctified, Flow) within 3 paragraphs of first use.
- [ ] **Cinematic Transitions:** Detail the *travel* (vehicle, atmosphere, sensory details) between scenes. Don't just cut to the destination.

### 3. Action & Physics (Hard Science)
- [ ] **Witcher Prep:** Show preparation, gear checks, and tactical planning before fights.
- [ ] **Physics Compliance:**
    - [ ] No Artificial Gravity (use Thrust or Mag-Boots).
    - [ ] No Warp/FTL (use Fusion Torches).
    - [ ] Momentum/Recoil matters in Zero-G.
    - [ ] Heat management (radiators/heatsinks) for energy weapons.
- [ ] **Viper Squad Logic:** Zero cannot hack their bodies (Cyber-Pure). He can only hack their weapons.
