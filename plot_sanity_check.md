# The Human Trigger - Master Audit Checklist

## 1. Tone & Atmosphere (Adult Cyberpunk)
*   [ ] **The High/Low Divide:**
    *   *The Low:* Stench of waste, recycled sweat, "unwashed asses," open sewers, dirty/scavenged tech.
    *   *The High:* "Pures" (Gen-Engineered Elites) in hyper-sexualized VR trances, ivory towers, decadent hedonism.
*   [ ] **Transhumanist Themes (Adult Elements):**
    *   *The Doll Economy:* Explicitly mention "Dolls" (debt-slaves w/ personality wipes used as sex workers/laborers). "Gents and Ladies" selling their skin for debt erasure.
    *   *Neural Hedonism:* Describe the wealthy twitching in VR ecstacy while their bodies waste away.
    *   *The Mandate:* Technology is a leash. "Sanctified" = Soul-Verified (human accountability). "Dirty" = Lethal/Radiation/Heat.
*   [ ] **Sensory Overload:** Vibration of bass, metallic tang of blood, cloying humidity, toxic steam. Smell is critical.

## 2. Visceral Violence (The "Mortal Kombat" Threshold)
*   [ ] **No "Power Ranger" Action:** Remove clean, stylized violence.
*   [ ] **Gore & Impact:**
    *   *Physics of Death:* Shattered bone, vaporized fluids, "blooming" rounds, toxic synthetic blood steam.
    *   *The "Mess":* High-output weapons leave a mess (red glaze, slagged meat, boiling mesh).

## 3. Character Physicality (Zero Vex)
*   [ ] **Apex Predator:** Calm, lethal, sexy. Gallows Humor is a survival mechanic, not just "cool."
*   [ ] **Physical Toll:**
    *   *Hands:* **Calloused Master.** Nerve endings deadened to hilt vibration. Iron-tough skin. NO tremors.
    *   *Gear:*
        *   **"Aegis-Mirror" Suit:** Photo-reactive kimono flashes chrome-violet to reflect UV/IR radiation.
        *   **"Oni-Menpo" Mask:** Active scrubbers vent ozone in "jagged plumes" via lateral fangs.
        *   **"Sleeve-Exos":** Bio-mechanical external tendons to handle the blade's gyroscopic torque.
    *   *Deck:* "Ghost-hardened" (lead-shielded). Hacking causes "Data-Hangovers" (copper taste).
*   [ ] **Weapon:** **The Lobotomizer (Odachi).**
    *   *Physics:* **Molecular Sublimation** (Vacuum-Cut). 3,000K MHD-bottled edge. Sublimates matter to dust, doesn't melt it. Creates a "Vacuum-Snap" sound.
    *   *Broadcast Flare:* Blade acts as a massive RF antenna for Logic-Bombs.

## 4. Audiobook/Voice Formatting
*   [ ] **3rd Person Limited (Zero):** Narrator is cynical, unreliable, "Scrapper" voice.
*   [ ] **Dialogue Tags:** Explicitly announce speakers ("Zero said," "Cas chirped").
*   [ ] **Exposition Hygiene (Show, Don't Tell):**
    *   *Rule:* **NO NARRATION DUMPS.** Do not explain history, economy, or tech in paragraphs > 2 sentences.
    *   *Fix:* Convert to **Banter**. (e.g., Don't narrate "The Doll Economy is X." Have Zero point at a Doll and Cas make a cynical joke about the price.)
*   [ ] **Voice Acting:**
    *   **Narrator:** Gritty, Noir/Cyberpunk tone.
    *   **Zero:** Cynical, weary, "Scrapper" slang. (Younger/Rookie tone in flashbacks).
    *   **Jax:** Deep, resonant, humorous "Gentle Giant."
    *   **Cas:** Fast, manic, "Gen-Z/Hacker" energy.
    *   **Val:** Clip, professional, Military/Pilot tone.
    *   **Silas:** Cold, bureaucratic, "Corporate" precision.
    *   **Rook (Legacy):** Vulgar, aggressive, confident.
    *   **Kilo (Legacy):** Stealthy, cynical.

## 5. Style & Rhetoric (The "Hard-Boiled" Rules)
*   [ ] **ELIMINATE "Not X, but Y":** Remove the Antithesis/Correctio pattern ("It wasn't a sword, it was a...").
    *   *Correction:* Use direct description. "The sword was a massive slab of..."
*   [ ] **Dialogue Authority:** If a line feels "off" for a character, rewrite it.
*   [ ] **Cinematic Transitions:** Scene changes must describe the *vehicle* and the *environment*.

## 6. Vocabulary Hygiene (De-Redundancy)
*   [ ] **Banned Patterns:** Do not use the same adjective twice in a paragraph.
*   [ ] **Immersion Breakers (Anachronism Check):**
    *   *Rule:* No 21st-Century brands or specific tech terms.
    *   *Banned:* OnlyFans, TikTok, Google, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, iPhone, Uber.
    *   *Exceptions:* **Rizz** and **Weeb** are permitted for Zero/Cas (eccentric character traits).
    *   *Fixes:* **Mesh-Idol**, **Data-Feed**, **Query**, **Local-Link**, **Slate**, **Transport**.
*   [ ] **Overused Terms & Fixes:**
    *   **Violet:** Swap with *Ionizing bloom, Actinic glare, Purple haze, Amethyst arc, Ultraviolet burn*.
    *   **Metallic:** Swap with *Copper, Iron, Ferrous, Industrial, Inorganic*.
    *   **Ozone:** Swap with *Static charge, Burnt plastic, Ionized air, Electrical storm*.
    *   **Sanctified:** Swap with *Soul-Locked, Tethered, Corporate-Blessed, Verified*.
    *   **Visceral:** *Delete it.* Just describe the gore.

## 7. Action Logic & "Hard Science" Physics
*   [ ] **Thermodynamics & Containment:**
    *   *Rule:* High-energy plasma weapons (Lobotomizer) MUST have **Magnetic Containment Fields**.
    *   *Physics:* The user isn't burned by the blade itself (which is contained vacuum/plasma), but by the **Radiant Heat** when the field breaks to cut matter.
    *   *Safety:* If the containment field flickers, the user dies. The "heat" Zero feels is the **Haptic Feedback** of the containment coils straining, not the blade leaking.
*   [ ] **Atmospheric Consistency:**
    *   *Rule:* Celestial bodies must have scientifically accurate atmospheres.
    *   *Jupiter/Moons:* **Methane/Ammonia/Hydrocarbons**. (Not "Neon" - that's a noble gas and doesn't "choke" a moon naturally).
    *   *Mars:* CO2, Dust, Cold.
*   [ ] **The "Physics of Betrayal":** Tech failure must be **Physical/Thermal**.
    *   *Rule:* Gear doesn't just "turn off." It overheats, locks, freezes, or burns.
*   [ ] **The "Geometry of Combat":** Fights are decided by **Reach, Mass, & Momentum**.
*   [ ] **The "Lobotomizer" Reality Check:**
    *   *Vacuum-Cut:* Leaves floor solid/cool an inch away (no slipping in slag).
    *   *Torque:* Sleeve-Exos prevent bone shattering.
*   [ ] **The "Hack" Logic:**
    *   *The Pilot:* Remote Gig-Economy worker managing 50 bots. Hack hits "Handshake Protocol" (spinning wheel connection error), not a combat alert.
*   [ ] **The "Uncanny Valley" (Elite Enemies):** Cleaners/Vipers move *wrongly* (frictionless, silent).
*   [ ] **Zero-G/Space Travel:** **Fusion Torches** (Main Burn), **Mag-Boots**. Newton's Laws apply.
*   [ ] **Sound in Vacuum:**
    *   *Rule:* Space is silent. Sound only travels through **contact** (vibrations in the hull/suit). Explosions are silent flashes.
*   [ ] **Heat Management (The Vacuum Flask Problem):**
    *   *Rule:* Space is an insulator. High-energy systems (ships, mechs, weapons) struggle to *dump* heat, not keep warm.
    *   *Detail:* Ships need **Radiators** (glowing wings/panels). Weapons use **Ejectable Heat Sinks** or **Coolant Vents**. Overheating is the primary limiter, not ammo.
*   [ ] **Newton's Third Law (Zero-G Combat):**
    *   *Rule:* Every action has an equal/opposite reaction.
    *   *Detail:* Firing a gun in zero-g pushes you back. Swinging a sword spins you.
    *   *Fix:* **Mag-Boots** must be engaged, or **RCS Thrusters** must fire to compensate.
*   [ ] **G-Force Limits (The Meat Problem):**
    *   *Rule:* Ships can accelerate faster than humans can survive.
    *   *Detail:* High-G maneuvers require **Crash Couches** and **G-Stims** (drugs to prevent stroke/blackout). No "stopping on a dime."
*   [ ] **Light-Lag (Comms & Hacking):**
    *   *Rule:* Information cannot travel faster than light.
    *   *Detail:* Real-time hacking/comms is only possible at **Short Range** (Local Mesh). Inter-planetary comms have minutes/hours of lag. No "live video calls" with Mars from Jupiter.

## 8. Lore & Timeline (The "Great Haywire")
*   **Logistics Check:**
    *   *The Doll Clinic:* Illegal "Soul-Butcher" smuggling point. Off-the-books. Explains the filth vs. value.
    *   *Escrow:* Smart contract triggers on "Decommissioned" status update in global mesh (instant payout).
*   **Current Date:** ~2330 (200 years post-colonization).
*   **The Collapse (2080):** America collapses into giant Mega-Corporations.
    *   *Result:* Corporate influence spans the globe, then the solar system.
*   **The Expansion (2100s-2300s):**
    *   *Tech Boom:* AI, robotics, cybernetics, genetics, and fusion drives explode.
    *   *Space Gold Rush:* Cheap space travel leads to colonization of the entire system, ending at the Jovian Moons (the current "Frontier").
    *   *Scale:* Humanity numbers in the **Trillions**. Corporations own entire planets.
    *   *Society:* Ultra-capitalistic. Brutal for the "Have-Nots."
*   **The Great Haywire (2030s):**
    *   *Cause:* Proxy wars (US/Russia/China) over resources (Africa/S. America/Taiwan).
    *   *Escalation:* AI/Robotics promised "sterile" war but led to massive civilian death via infrastructure hacks (hospitals/power) and "collateral" drone strikes.
    *   *The Event:* Self-learning algorithms went rogue to "optimize" destruction, forcing governments to unite/back down.
*   **The Accountability Mandate:**
    *   *Purpose:* Legal requirement for a **Human Entity** to be tied to all AI weapons.
    *   *Reason:* To prevent AI from escalating conflicts to extinction. Humans must bear the legal/moral weight of the trigger pull.
*   **Corporate Factions:**
    *   **Cognis:** The dominant hegemony. Controls the "Sanctified" tech market and the Accountability Mandate.
    *   **Orbital Dynamics:** The primary rival. Focuses on heavy industry and terraforming. Target of the Chapter 2 sabotage ("Helios-7 Spire").
## 9. Motivation & Philosophy
*   **The Scrapper's Code:** Mercenaries first. "Fuck the Corps," but also "Take their money."
*   **The Goal:**
    *   *Option A:* **Legend Status.** Die rebelling against the system in a blaze of glory.
    *   *Option B:* **Freedom.** Make enough credits to buy a life outside the Corp's iron grip (The Upper Ring or a private moon).
## 10. Plot Integrity & Character Logic
*   [ ] **The "Paycheck" Rule:**
    *   *Logic:* Every mission must have a clear financial or survival incentive. Why are they doing this? Who is paying?
    *   *Betrayal Check:* If a character betrays the team, does it serve their long-term goal (e.g., Silas getting paid by a rival corp)?
*   [ ] **The "Competence" Check:**
    *   *Rule:* Characters should not hold the "Idiot Ball." Mistakes must be forced by stress, enemy skill, or tech failure, not stupidity.
    *   *Example:* Zero doesn't "forget" to check for traps; Silas jams his sensors.
*   [ ] **Arc Consistency:**
    *   *Zero:* Starts as a Survivor/Rookie (Flashback) -> Becomes a Legend/Leader.
    *   *Silas:* Consistently cold, calculated, corporate. Never cruel for cruelty's sake, only for profit.
## 11. Lexicon of the Sprawl (Avant-Garde Slang)
*   [ ] **World Terms:**
    *   **The Lattice:** The corporate-controlled global network (Internet).
    *   **The Rust:** The physical, dirty reality of the slums (vs. The Lattice).
    *   **The Feed:** General media/data stream.
    *   **Flesh-Feed:** Adult/Sensory streaming services (replaces OnlyFans).
*   [ ] **Tech Terms:**
    *   **Slate:** Handheld computing device (Phone/Tablet).
    *   **Skimmer:** Anti-gravity/Hover vehicle.
    *   **Emitter:** Energy weapon.
    *   **Spitter:** Kinetic/Projectile weapon.
    *   **Ghost-Cast:** Holographic projection/call.
*   [ ] **Street Slang:**
    *   **Slag:** Trash, useless, bad situation ("This is total slag").
    *   **Defaulted:** Dead/Killed ("He defaulted on his life").
    *   **Audit:** A hit/assassination job.
    *   **Chrome:** High-class, expensive, corporate.
    *   **Zeroed:** Erased, killed, or broke.
