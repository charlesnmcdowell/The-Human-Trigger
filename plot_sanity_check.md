# Global Book Edits: Audiobook Formatting
*   **Goal:** Rewrite the entire book to be "audiobook friendly."
*   **Cast Structure:**
    *   **Narrator:** Handles all narration (Third Person) and voices for side characters.
    *   **Main Characters:** Each main character (from the profile section) has a dedicated voice actor for their dialogue.
*   **Format:**
    *   **Perspective:** Third Person Limited (Focus on Zero).
    *   **Narrator Voice:** The narrator describes the scene and actions from Zero's perspective (using "Zero" or "He," not "I"), but maintains Zero's cynical, scrapper voice in the descriptions.
    *   **Dialogue Tags:** The narrator explicitly tags dialogue (e.g., "Zero said," "Jax rumbled") to cue the listener for the voice actor change.
    *   **Unreliable Narrator:** The events are filtered through Zero's perception, meaning the narrator can be biased or limited by what Zero knows/feels.
    *   **Dialogue:** Performed by specific voice actors.
*   **Pacing:** Slowed down for audiobook consumption. Detail-rich.
*   **Action Style:** "Apocalypse Bound" style (Gore, Explosions, Visceral).
*   **World Building:** Delivered via character banter/dialogue rather than exposition dumps.
*   **New Terminology:**
    *   **Cas's Class:** "Grid-Breaker" (or similar unique term for Netrunner).
    *   **Zero's Gear:** Samurai armor/katana has a specific heist backstory.

# Plot Sanity Check & Timeline

## Series Bible: Lore, Tech, & Factions

### Factions & Organizations
*   **The Corporation:** Dominant political/military force. Owns the *Golden Spire* and Project NS-FW-32. Obsessed with "Accountability," "Sanctified Tech," and control.
*   **Viper Squad / Corporate Aces:** Elite mercenaries in customized power armor. Trackable, dangerous, expensive.
*   **Void-Sharks:** Local pirate gang in the Jovian shadow. Petty criminals compared to the Corp.
*   **Neon Jackals (Defunct):** Zero's old crew. Specialized in high-end theft. Wiped out in the *Golden Spire* ambush.
*   **The Human Trigger (New Crew):** Zero, Val, Jax, Cas (and Orion). Fugitives.

### Technology
*   **Sanctified Tech:** Corporate-approved. Biometric locks, server handshakes, safety protocols. Vulnerable to EMP and "admin override."
*   **Dirty / Jailbroken Tech:** Illegal, modified. Analog triggers, no safety limits. Zero's preferred gear.
*   **Thermal Katana:** "Red Thermal Katana." Modified industrial plasma saw. "Contained error in physics." Can cut through durasteel.
*   **Project NS-FW-32 (Orion):** "Not Safe For Work." Prototype nuclear-fusion Titan. Contains the uploaded consciousness of a human child (Orion). Burns out standard pilots; requires high neural plasticity.
*   **Kill-Creds:** Underground currency/reputation system based on recorded acts of violence/skill.

### Locations
*   **Shadow of Jupiter:** The main setting. The slums/fringe of the system.
*   **The Golden Spire:** Corporate transport/bank. Scene of the heist and the inciting incident.
*   **Scrap-Vats of Europa:** Zero's origin. Radioactive bilge where he learned "The Flow."
*   **Haywire Graveyard:** Massive debris field of old warships. Unstable radiation.
*   **Orion-Nex:** Tier-2 automated supply depot.
*   **Pirate Haven:** The ultimate destination/safe harbor (End of Book 1).

### Character Voices & Quality Control
*   **Zero Vex (Hiro Archetype):**
    *   *Voice:* Cynical, noir-inflected, witty. Treats absurdity with deadpan acceptance.
    *   *Key Phrases/Traits:* "Expensing pain," "The Flow," "Scrap-Vat reflex."
    *   *Check:* Does he sound too earnest? Make him dryer.
*   **Cas (Jazz Archetype):**
    *   *Voice:* Fast-talking, hustler, transactional.
    *   *Key Phrases/Traits:* "Kill-Creds," "Insurance premiums," "Minting the footage."
    *   *Check:* Is she just providing exposition? Give her a selfish/financial angle.
*   **Val (Tactician):**
    *   *Voice:* High-born, clipped, military precision.
    *   *Key Phrases/Traits:* "Asset," "Liability," "Unauthorized."
    *   *Check:* Is she too friendly? Keep her cold/professional initially.
*   **Jax (The Heavy):**
    *   *Voice:* Slow, tectonic, simple but wise.
    *   *Traits:* Loves food/protein. Borged-out strength.

### Quality Control Checklist
*   [ ] **Repetition Check:** Scan for overused phrases ("The universe wanted him dead," "Zero did X"). Vary sentence structure.
*   [ ] **Rhetorical Optimization (Antithesis/Correctio Overuse):**
    *   **Goal:** Reduce the "Not X, but Y" structure (e.g., "The blade didn't just hum; it growled," "I wasn't here to fight; I was here to steal") by ~50%.
    *   **Action:** Rewrite as direct descriptions or metaphors while keeping the hard-boiled tone.
    *   **Exception:** Preserve only the most impactful contrasts essential to emotional beats.
*   [ ] **Action & Tone (Witcher Style):**
    *   **Goal:** Increase grit, robot destruction, explosions, and gore.
    *   **Style:** Emphasize *preparation* (Witcher style). Show characters prepping gear, analyzing threats, and using specific styles to solve problems.
    *   **Physics Check:** Ensure all sci-fi elements are grounded in plausible current physics (e.g., momentum, heat dissipation, structural integrity).
    *   **Intensity:** Focus on near-misses (bullet dodges, ricochets) to heighten tension.
*   [ ] **Voice Consistency:** Ensure dialogue matches the specific archetypes above.
*   [ ] **Show, Don't Tell:** Use Third Person (Narrator) to describe the world, while voice actors bring characters to life.
*   [ ] **Logic Check:** Ensure tech rules (Sanctified vs. Dirty) are consistent.
*   [ ] **Timeline:** Ensure the transition from Ch 1 (Present) to Ch 2 (Flashback/Heist) to Ch 4 (Reunion) holds up.
