# The Human Trigger - Master Audit Checklist

## 1. Tone & Atmosphere (Adult Cyberpunk)
*   [ ] **The High/Low Divide:**
    *   *The Low:* Stench of waste, recycled sweat, "unwashed asses," open sewers, dirty/scavenged tech.
    *   *The High:* "Pures" (Gen-Engineered Elites) in hyper-sexualized VR trances, ivory towers, decadent hedonism.
*   [ ] **Transhumanist Themes (Adult Elements):**
    *   *The Doll Economy:* Explicitly mention "Dolls" (debt-slaves w/ personality wipes used as sex workers/laborers). "Gents and Ladies" selling their skin for debt erasure.
    *   *Neural Hedonism:* Describe the wealthy twitching in VR ecstacy while their bodies waste away.
    *   *The Mandate:* Technology is a leash. "Sanctified" = Soul-Verified (human accountability). "Dirty" = Lethal/Radiation/Heat.
*   [ ] **Sensory Overload:** Vibration of bass, metallic tang of blood, cloying humidity, toxic steam. Smell is critical.

## 2. Visceral Violence (The "Mortal Kombat" Threshold)
*   [ ] **No "Power Ranger" Action:** Remove clean, stylized violence.
*   [ ] **Gore & Impact:**
    *   *Physics of Death:* Shattered bone, vaporized fluids, "blooming" rounds, toxic synthetic blood steam.
    *   *The "Mess":* High-output weapons leave a mess (red glaze, slagged meat, boiling mesh).

## 3. Character Physicality (Zero Vex)
*   [ ] **Apex Predator:** Calm, lethal, sexy.
*   [ ] **Physical Toll:**
    *   *Hands:* Thick, iron-tough callouses (leather-like) from extreme training.
    *   *Gear:* Impact-Dampening Bracers, Lead-Lined Kimono/Gear. **Energy Shield Emitter & Rebreather Mask**.
    *   *Weapon:* The Lobotomizer (Odachi) - 5ft unshielded plasma edge. "Low-frequency snarl."
*   [ ] **Voice:** Cynical, weary, but confident. Uses modern slang ("Rizz", "Weeb").

## 4. Audiobook/Voice Formatting
*   [ ] **3rd Person Limited (Zero):** Narrator is cynical, unreliable, "Scrapper" voice.
*   [ ] **Dialogue Tags:** Explicitly announce speakers ("Zero said," "Cas chirped").
*   [ ] **Exposition Hygiene (Show, Don't Tell):**
    *   *Rule:* **NO NARRATION DUMPS.** Do not explain history, economy, or tech in paragraphs > 2 sentences.
    *   *Fix:* Convert to **Banter**. (e.g., Don't narrate "The Doll Economy is X." Have Zero point at a Doll and Cas make a cynical joke about the price.)
*   [ ] **Voice Acting:**
    *   **Narrator:** Gritty, Noir/Cyberpunk tone.
    *   **Zero:** Cynical, weary, "Scrapper" slang.
    *   **Jax:** Deep, resonant, humorous "Gentle Giant."
    *   **Cas:** Fast, manic, "Gen-Z/Netrunner" energy.
    *   **Val:** Clip, professional, Military/Pilot tone.
    *   **Silas:** Cold, bureaucratic, "Corporate" precision.

## 5. Style & Rhetoric (The "Hard-Boiled" Rules)
*   [ ] **ELIMINATE "Not X, but Y":** Remove the Antithesis/Correctio pattern ("It wasn't a sword, it was a...").
    *   *Correction:* Use direct description. "The sword was a massive slab of..."
*   [ ] **Dialogue Authority:** If a line feels "off" for a character, rewrite it.
*   [ ] **Cinematic Transitions:** Scene changes must describe the *vehicle* and the *environment*.

## 6. Vocabulary Hygiene (De-Redundancy)
*   [ ] **Banned Patterns:** Do not use the same adjective twice in a paragraph.
*   [ ] **Overused Terms & Fixes:**
    *   **Violet:** Swap with *Ionizing bloom, Actinic glare, Purple haze, Amethyst arc, Ultraviolet burn*.
    *   **Metallic:** Swap with *Copper, Iron, Ferrous, Industrial, Inorganic*.
    *   **Ozone:** Swap with *Static charge, Burnt plastic, Ionized air, Electrical storm*.
    *   **Sanctified:** Swap with *Soul-Locked, Tethered, Corporate-Blessed, Verified*.
    *   **Visceral:** *Delete it.* Just describe the gore.

## 7. Action Logic & "Hard Science" Physics
*   [ ] **The "Physics of Betrayal":** Tech failure must be **Physical/Thermal**.
    *   *Rule:* Gear doesn't just "turn off." It overheats, locks, freezes, or burns.
*   [ ] **The "Geometry of Combat":** Fights are decided by **Reach, Mass, & Momentum**.
*   [ ] **The "Uncanny Valley" (Elite Enemies):** Cleaners/Vipers move *wrongly* (frictionless, silent).
*   [ ] **Zero-G/Space Travel:** **Fusion Torches** (Main Burn), **Mag-Boots**. Newton's Laws apply.

## 8. Lore & Timeline (The "Great Haywire")
*   **Current Date:** ~2330 (200 years post-colonization).
*   **The Collapse (2080):** America collapses into giant Mega-Corporations.
    *   *Result:* Corporate influence spans the globe, then the solar system.
*   **The Expansion (2100s-2300s):**
    *   *Tech Boom:* AI, robotics, cybernetics, genetics, and fusion drives explode.
    *   *Space Gold Rush:* Cheap space travel leads to colonization of the entire system, ending at the Jovian Moons (the current "Frontier").
    *   *Scale:* Humanity numbers in the **Trillions**. Corporations own entire planets.
    *   *Society:* Ultra-capitalistic. Brutal for the "Have-Nots."
*   **The Great Haywire (2030s):**
    *   *Cause:* Proxy wars (US/Russia/China) over resources (Africa/S. America/Taiwan).
    *   *Escalation:* AI/Robotics promised "sterile" war but led to massive civilian death via infrastructure hacks (hospitals/power) and "collateral" drone strikes.
    *   *The Event:* Self-learning algorithms went rogue to "optimize" destruction, forcing governments to unite/back down.
*   **The Accountability Mandate:**
    *   *Purpose:* Legal requirement for a **Human Entity** to be tied to all AI weapons.
    *   *Reason:* To prevent AI from escalating conflicts to extinction. Humans must bear the legal/moral weight of the trigger pull.
*   **Motivation:** **Luxury & Legend Status**. "The Upper Ring." "Becoming Immortals in history, not biology."
