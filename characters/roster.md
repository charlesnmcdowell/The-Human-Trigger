# The Crew of the NS-FW-32

## Zero Vex (The Jailbreaker)
**Archetype:** Shadow-Runner / Rogue Pilot

**Visuals:**
- African American with purple locs tied back in a samurai knot.
- Wears a high-tech leather street-wear kimono and a custom backpack rigged to hold his specialized katana saya.

**Weapon of Choice:**
- A high-frequency Red Thermal Katana used for both combat and "creative entry" through hull plating.

**The Edge:**
- Zero doesn't just pilot the NSFW-32; he treats its neural link like a terminal. His "Jailbreak" ability allows him to bypass AI safety limiters, pushing the mech's nuclear fusion core into the "Redline" for bursts of impossible speed.

**Traits:**
- **Pros:** Loyal, determined, honorable, curious.
- **Cons:** Risky, self-sacrificing, meddlesome, prying.
- **Personality Archetype:** "The Last Samurai of the Sprawl." Modeled after Hiro Protagonist (*Snow Crash*). He is intelligent, slightly arrogant about his skills but deeply cynical about the system. He speaks with a dry, noir-inflected wit. He treats the absurd reality of his world with a deadpan acceptance.

**Crew Dynamics:**
- **Cas:** Works very well with her; she is loved and cherished by him.
- **Jax:** Neutral relationship.
- **Val:** High amount of conflict.

## Valkyrie "Val" Orion (The Tactician)
**Archetype:** Disgraced Corporate Prodigy

**Visuals:**
- Preppy-looking Black girl with a sharp, disciplined posture that betrays her high-born military training.
- Usually seen in a clean, modified flight suit.

**The Role:**
- The only one with legitimate "Tier-1" pilot training. She acts as the crew's navigator and tactical lead, translating Zero’s chaotic hacker instincts into viable military maneuvers.

**The Conflict:**
- She is a runaway from the very corporation that built the NSFW-32, making her a "Traitor Asset" with a massive bounty on her head.

**Traits:**
- **Pros:** Intelligent, poised, well-bred, sophisticated.
- **Cons:** Pretentious, poser, hot-tempered.

**Crew Dynamics:**
- **Jax:** Gets along well.
- **Cas:** Neutral.
- **Zero:** Skeptical of his sanity.

## Jax (The Heavy)
**Archetype:** Borged-out Breaker

**Visuals:**
- Caucasian, exceptionally tall and muscular.
- His body is a map of industrial cybernetics—heavy hydraulic limbs and reinforced plating designed for Jovian mining.

**Weapon of Choice:**
- A heavy, customized Anti-Armor Rail-Rifle.

**The Role:**
- Maintenance and Muscle. He keeps the NSFW-32 from shaking itself apart after a fusion flare and handles ship-to-ship boarding actions where raw power is the only way through the door.

**Traits:**
- **Pros:** Chill, wise, organized.
- **Cons:** Cowardly, risk-averse.

**Crew Dynamics:**
- Gets along with everybody.

## Caspian "Cas" (The Systems Ghost)
**Archetype:** Tech-Specialist / E-War

**Visuals:**
- Thai girl, same height as Zero, with dark skin and hair tied in signature pigtails.
- She wears thick, glowing Augmented Reality (AR) glasses that are constantly streaming data.

**The Role:**
- The "Brain" of the transport ship. While Zero is in the cockpit, Cas is in the ship’s mainframe, spoofing corporate transponders, jamming long-range comms, and keeping the "Hunter-Killer" AI off their tail.

**The Vibe:**
- Irreverent and hyper-focused. She views the entire solar system as a series of locks just waiting for her to find the key.

**Traits:**
- **Pros:** Kindness, curious, brave, optimistic.
- **Cons:** Childish, impatient, flirty.
- **Personality Archetype:** "The Hustler Prodigy." Modeled after Jazz Bashara (*Artemis*). She is whip-smart, sarcastic, and speaks in a rapid-fire, hustler dialect. She is constantly looking for the angle, referencing prices, bribes, and the "economy" of the situation. She masks her genius with irreverence.

**Crew Dynamics:**
- **General:** Comical relief, annoys everyone.
- **Zero:** Loved and cherished by him.
- **Val:** Neutral.

## The Machine: Project NS-FW-32
**Classification:** Nuclear-Fusion Bipedal Titan (Experimental)

**Signature Feature:**
- An exposed, pulsing blue fusion core that glows through the chest plating.

**Personality:**
- Features a "rogue" narrow AI that only responds to Zero’s illegal "Forbidden Sync" protocols.
