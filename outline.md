# The Human Trigger - Outline

## Origin: The Blade and the Bit
**The Swordsman:**
Zero grew up as a "Scrapper" in the radioactive bilge of the Europa shipyards. Ammunition was corporate-regulated and expensive, but high-frequency industrial cutting tools were everywhere. He salvaged a broken Thermal Plasma Saw and refined it into his signature Red Thermal Katana. He didn't learn from a dojo; he learned "Flow-State" combat by dodging the high-speed automated robotic arms in the scrap-vats. If he wasn't faster than the AI, he was dead.

**The Hacker:**
His "Jailbreaking" skills came from the Accountability Mandate. To get the scrap-bots to ignore him, he had to learn to "ghost" their sensors. He discovered he had a rare neural plasticity that allowed him to "handshake" with machine logic. While other kids were learning to read, Zero was learning to "talk" to the silicon ghosts of the Haywire-era ruins.

## Revised 10-Chapter Outline

### CH 1: The Scrapper’s Flow
**Intro:** Zero and Cas introduce themselves through action. A security bot identifies Zero via a "Wanted" blurb. Cas saves Zero with a quick hack, prompting Zero to recall their meeting.
**Action:** High-octane salvage run. Zero uses his Red Thermal Katana (backstory: stolen from a high-tier vault) to dismantle drones.
**Style:** Visceral, gore/explosion heavy. Slowed down to let the skills breathe.

### CH 2: The Meat Grinder
**The Heist:** The "Golden Spire" job. The team (Neon Jackals) infiltrates.
**The Turn:** It's an almost-success. They get the goods, but a traitor (unidentified) triggers an ambush.
**The Sacrifice:** Zero realizes they are trapped. He uses "dirty" tech to create a massive distraction/explosion, intending to sacrifice himself so the team can escape.
**The Aftermath:** Zero wakes up/escapes by unknown means (miracle/luck). He tries to contact the team but gets silence. He assumes they are dead or captured.

### CH 3: The Offer
Zero, alone and believing his friends are gone, is found by Silas (The Agent). Silas exploits Zero's desperation and "nothing to lose" attitude. Offers him the "Human Trigger" job.

### CH 4: The Outlaw Link
Zero meets the new crew (Val, Jax). He is cold, traumatized from the "loss" of his old team.
**Reveal (Later Arc Setup):** The reader knows (or hints are dropped) that the old team is alive and being used to hunt him, but Zero doesn't know yet.

### CH 5: The Haywire Graveyard
The team travels to a ruined sector. Zero explains the lore of the Haywire while navigating ancient, rogue security bots. He uses his hacking and blade in tandem—disabling shields with a "ghost-jack" and finishing the core with a red-hot slash.

### CH 6: The Ghost in the Machine
Cas helps Zero "Overclock" his neural jacks. They realize Zero’s brain is unique because it treats code like a physical space. He "sees" firewalls as obstacles to be cut, just like steel.

### CH 7: The Orion-Nex Breach
Infiltration. Zero uses his katana to cut a hole in the ceiling of the Titan-bay, dropping down like a shadow.

### CH 8: The NSFW Awakening
Zero syncs with the NS-FW-32. The mech’s HUD isn't just data; it’s a VR representation of a battlefield where the mech’s massive fusion-sword feels like an extension of Zero’s own katana.

### CH 9: The Gauntlet
The escape. Zero faces the Corporate Aces. He doesn't just shoot at them; he uses "Blink-Steps" and "Blade-Parries" with a 50-ton machine, a feat only possible because of his "Scrap-Vat" reflexes.

### CH 10: The Void
The team secures the transport ship. Zero stands on the hull in the NSFW-32, red blade glowing against the black of space, as they jump to the Pirate Haven.
