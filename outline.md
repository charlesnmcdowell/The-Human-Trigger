# The Human Trigger - Outline

## Origin: The Blade and the Bit
**The Swordsman:**
Zero grew up as a "Scrapper" in the radioactive bilge of the Europa shipyards. Ammunition was corporate-regulated and expensive, but high-frequency industrial cutting tools were everywhere. He salvaged a broken Thermal Plasma Saw and refined it into his signature Red Thermal Katana. He didn't learn from a dojo; he learned "Flow-State" combat by dodging the high-speed automated robotic arms in the scrap-vats. If he wasn't faster than the AI, he was dead.

**The Hacker:**
His "Jailbreaking" skills came from the Accountability Mandate. To get the scrap-bots to ignore him, he had to learn to "ghost" their sensors. He discovered he had a rare neural plasticity that allowed him to "handshake" with machine logic. While other kids were learning to read, Zero was learning to "talk" to the silicon ghosts of the Haywire-era ruins.

## Revised 10-Chapter Outline

### CH 1: The Scrapper’s Flow
The book opens with Zero in a high-speed "Salvage Run." We see him use his Red Thermal Katana to dismantle a security drone with the grace of a dancer. Through internal monologue, he recalls the "Scrap-Vat" days where a blade didn't need a corporate permit to fire—it just needed a steady hand.

### CH 2: The Meat Grinder
The old team heist. Zero's hacking allows them to bypass the initial gates, but the corporate ambush is too much. He watches his friends die because their "sanctified" gear locks up under an EMP. Zero’s "dirty" tech and blade are the only things that don't fail him.

### CH 3: The Offer
The Agent finds Zero. He notes that Zero is the only street-rat in the Jovian system with a 100% Sync Compatibility for un-lobotomized hardware. He offers Zero the chance to be the "Trigger" for something that can actually fight back.

### CH 4: The Outlaw Link
Zero meets the crew. Jax is impressed by the custom-weighted balance of Zero’s katana, recognizing it as high-tier industrial salvage. Val is skeptical of his "scrapper" style until Zero hacks the ship's galley to produce real coffee instead of corporate sludge.

### CH 5: The Haywire Graveyard
The team travels to a ruined sector. Zero explains the lore of the Haywire while navigating ancient, rogue security bots. He uses his hacking and blade in tandem—disabling shields with a "ghost-jack" and finishing the core with a red-hot slash.

### CH 6: The Ghost in the Machine
Cas helps Zero "Overclock" his neural jacks. They realize Zero’s brain is unique because it treats code like a physical space. He "sees" firewalls as obstacles to be cut, just like steel.

### CH 7: The Orion-Nex Breach
Infiltration. Zero uses his katana to cut a hole in the ceiling of the Titan-bay, dropping down like a shadow.

### CH 8: The NSFW Awakening
Zero syncs with the NS-FW-32. The mech’s HUD isn't just data; it’s a VR representation of a battlefield where the mech’s massive fusion-sword feels like an extension of Zero’s own katana.

### CH 9: The Gauntlet
The escape. Zero faces the Corporate Aces. He doesn't just shoot at them; he uses "Blink-Steps" and "Blade-Parries" with a 50-ton machine, a feat only possible because of his "Scrap-Vat" reflexes.

### CH 10: The Void
The team secures the transport ship. Zero stands on the hull in the NSFW-32, red blade glowing against the black of space, as they jump to the Pirate Haven.
