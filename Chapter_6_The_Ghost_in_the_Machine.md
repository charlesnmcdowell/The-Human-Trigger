# Chapter 6: The Ghost in the Machine

The Void-Sharks opened fire.

"Contacts!" Val called. "Jax, dorsal turrets. Cas, jam comms."

"On it," Cas said. "Deploying countermeasures."

Zero stood on the hull. The skiffs strafed the *Rusty Nail*.

He locked onto the lead skiff. "Hades. Target solution."

*// PROBABILITY OF INTERCEPT: 94%. //*

He grabbed a massive bulkhead plate and hurled it like a frisbee. It sheared through the skiff’s engine. Explosion.

"One down."

The other two turned on him. Plasma bolts slammed into his shields.

He activated jump-jets, launching from the dreadnought. He landed on an asteroid, used it as a springboard, and ignited the blade mid-flight.

He cut the second ship in half. Debris vented into space.

The third skiff fled.

He returned to the ship.

"Cas," Zero said. "I found a ghost in the code. Encrypted."

Cas jacked in. "Pre-War encryption. Give me ten minutes."

She played the log.

*"This is Dr. Aris Thorne. I uploaded him. My son. Orion. He's not a weapon. He's a child."*

"Orion," Zero whispered.

*// DESIGNATION UPDATE: ORION. //*

"We just stole a kid," Cas whispered.

"We keep this secret," Zero said. "Val might try to return him."
