# The Human Trigger

## Synopsis
In the methane-choked slums of Jupiter’s moons, human life is cheap, but Accountability is priceless. In a world where AI is barred from lethal force, only a "Human Trigger" can authorize a kill. Zero Vex is a street-level scrapper who hacks the system with a thermal katana and black-market jacks. But when a heist goes sideways, Zero is forced into a "Forbidden Sync" with the ultimate prize: Project NS-FW-32, a nuclear-fusion titan of mayhem. To the suits, it’s a trillion-dollar asset; to Zero, it’s the "Not Safe For Work," and he’s just jailbroken its soul.

The escape is a gauntlet of fire. With a wall of corporate goons and elite mercenaries standing between his crew and the void, Zero must push the NSFW’s experimental core to the redline or go out in a nuclear bang. Supported by Val, a disgraced corporate pilot, Jax, a borged-out heavy-lifter, Glitch, a systems ghost, and Cas, a cynical blockade smuggler, Zero hijacks a transport ship and vanishes into the belt. Now, they are the system's most wanted fugitives, taking high-stakes mercenary contracts to build a pirate haven and dismantle the corporate machine—one "unauthorized" kill at a time.
