# Chapter 3: The Blind Contract

Zero sat on a crate in the cargo hold of the *Scrap-Vulture*, a rusted transport skimming the smog layer of Sector 4. The adrenaline from the fight was fading, replaced by the dull throb of a headache. He wiped the last of the nosebleed away with the back of his glove, staring at the Cognis core humming on the deck. It was a cylinder of blue light, worth more than the ship they were flying in.

"You okay, Zero?" Cas asked, her voice echoing from the cockpit. "You zoned out for a second there."

"Just a glitch," Zero muttered, shaking his head. The memory of the Helios-7 Spire—of Rook grinning as he died, of Kilo's silence—clung to him like static. It had been three months, but the smell of burnt plastic always brought it back. He forced the ghost of the Flesh-Feed Star out of his mind. That was the past. This was business.

"Well, snap out of it," Cas said. "Because we just got a ping on the Dark-Mesh. Priority One. Encrypted."

Zero frowned. "We just finished a job, Cas. I need a drink and a week in a sensory-deprivation tank."

Zero stepped into the cockpit, the synthetic whiskey a warm weight in his gut. The air here was brisk—14°C—as the ship’s Life Support diverted every spare watt to the Decryption Array humming in the machine room aft.

He wasn't shirtless; he wore a charcoal-grey Thermal Compression Top that clung to his corded frame like a second skin. It was designed to regulate body temperature under a heavy kimono, but in the chilly cockpit, it just made him look like a shadow waiting to move. He hadn't bothered with pants yet, just his grey thermal boxers.

"You're late," Cas quipped, her fingers flying across the holographic nav-slate. She was wrapped in a heavy, oversized flight jacket over her white tank-top, her "Terra-Born" islander blood clearly hating the LS-tax. She looked up, her beady eyes scanning his thermal-clad frame. "I can hear your metabolism redlining from here, Samurai. Drink the whiskey; you're going to need the calories."

"Turn the heaters up, Cas. The air feels like a dead man's breath," Zero grunted.

"Can't. The array is pulling a massive load on this 'Pre-Haywire' ping," she said, tapping a display showing the ship's power distribution. "LS is on a low-priority loop until I crack this handshake." She sat cross-legged, the jacket bunching up to reveal white, high-cut panties that looked like **Gilded-Lily** silk.

"Expensive taste for a freezer-burn enthusiast," Zero noted, his hazel eyes locking onto the logo on the silk. "Executive-tier laundry in a Sector 4 cargo-ship? Who’d you lift those from?"

"Gift from a grateful client," Cas smirked, pulling the jacket tighter but letting her gaze drift lower, lingering on the obvious morning wood pressing against his boxers. "I guess you were overcompensating with that sword."

Zero didn't blink. He just took another drink. "The ping, Cas."

"Right. Quit eye-balling my 'benefits' and look at the math," Cas said, tapping the screen with a manicured nail. "We aren't talking pocket change or scrap-fees. This is the 'exit-the-planet' kind of money. This is the 'never-breathe-recycled-farts-again' payout."

Zero leaned over her shoulder, the magnetic soles of his boots clicking on the deck. He looked at the screen. The message was simple, text-only, no sender ID.

**CONTRACT: PROJECT NSFW-32**
**OBJECTIVE: ACQUISITION & EXTRACTION**
**TARGET: COGNIS VAULT, DECK 12**
**PAYMENT: 50 MILLION CREDITS**

"50 million credits," Zero whispered.

He didn't care about the criminal record. Going straight was a slow death sentence. He’d seen the 'law-abiding' citizens of the Sprawl—wage slaves packing dolls into crates, their eyes dead, their bodies failing from malnutrition and stress while they thanked the Corp for the privilege of breathing recycled air. Even the Dolls were 'legal' workers. The system didn't reward obedience; it consumed it.

"Do the math," Zero said, his voice low.

"Math’s already clocked, Samurai," Cas said, popping a bubble of gum. "Your average Tier-4 drone pulls forty-five k a year—and that’s if they’re lucky. You want the six-figure bracket? You gotta sell your likeness rights and hope the Corp doesn't use your face for a bio-sludge ad. At a hundred grand, it’s a five-century grind to hit this payout. Five hundred years of boot-licking, Zero. We don't have that kind of shelf-life."

"We don't have five hundred years," Zero said. "We have maybe five before the radiation in this sector cooks us or a Scrapper gets lucky."

"Exactly," Cas grinned. "We take the money, and we disappear. I've got a line on a Shielded Atoll in the Tyros Sub-Surface Sea. It's a pressurized dome anchored to the thermal vents. Real dirt, Zero. Real pines. And fifty million? That doesn't just buy the land; it buys the Life-Support Endowment—the massive energy budget required to keep the vents running so the trees don't freeze into glass. We buy our way into the Closed-Loop Economy and never have to look at a scrubber again."

"Who's the client?" Zero asked, his eyes narrowing.

"Anonymous," Cas said, her fingers dancing over the keys. "But the encryption? It's 'Pre-Haywire' grade. We're talking 2030s architecture—stuff that predates the Mandate by centuries. I can't crack it, which means this isn't some script-kiddy. This is a surviving artifact. Maybe a rogue AI that slipped the leash before the Great Haywire, or a Corp hoarding ancient tech."

"It's a trap," Zero said flatly. "Nobody pays that much for a heist unless it's suicide. And 'Pre-Haywire' tech? That screams corporate black-ops."

"A team," Zero scoffed. "I work alone."

"Not for fifty million, you don't," Cas countered. "Look at the specs. It's a Titan. A prototype. The NSFW-32. Rumor is, it cooks every pilot who plugs into it. That's why they need you. They need a Scrapper who runs 'Dirty' tech. Someone who can override the safeties."

Zero looked at the schematic. The machine was a beast—forty feet of matte-black armor and fusion reactors. It looked like a god of war wrapped in industrial chains.

"Set a course," Zero said, turning back to the hold. "Let's go see who wants to play god."

The *Scrap-Vulture* docked at the service port of Deck 12 an hour later. The airlock cycled with a hiss of decontamination spray. Zero stepped out, the Lobotomizer strapped to his back, his hand hovering near the hilt.

"I'll stay on the line," Cas said over the Link. "I'm ghosting your signature. To the local grid, you're just a maintenance worker with a really aggressive tool belt."

"Keep your eyes open," Zero said. "If this goes south, dump the core and run."

"Ye of little faith," Cas chirped. "Go make us rich, Samurai."

Zero moved into the corridor. The air here was hotter, thicker. He could hear the distant thrum of riot control measures—flash-bangs and screaming. Deck 12 was already a war zone.

Perfect cover.

He checked his HUD. The rendezvous point was a docking bay on the far side of the riot. He adjusted his mask, the active scrubbers hissing as the lateral fangs vented superheated, filtered air, clearing the tear gas from his intake.

"Time to work," Zero whispered.
