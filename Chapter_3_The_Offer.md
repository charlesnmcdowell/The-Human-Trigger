# Chapter 3: The Blind Contract

Zero sat on a crate in the cargo hold of the *Scrap-Vulture*, a rusted transport skimming the smog layer of Sector 4. The adrenaline from the fight was fading, replaced by the dull throb of a headache. He wiped the last of the nosebleed away with the back of his glove, staring at the Cognis core humming on the deck. It was a cylinder of blue light, worth more than the ship they were flying in.

"You okay, Zero?" Cas asked, her voice echoing from the cockpit. "You zoned out for a second there."

"Just a glitch," Zero muttered, shaking his head. The memory of the Helios-7 Spire—of Rook grinning as he died, of Kilo's silence—clung to him like static. It had been three months, but the smell of burnt plastic always brought it back. He forced the ghost of the Flesh-Feed Star out of his mind. That was the past. This was business.

"Well, snap out of it," Cas said, spinning her chair to face him. "Because we just got a ping on the Dark-Mesh. Priority One. Encrypted."

Zero frowned. "We just finished a job, Cas. I need a drink and a week in a sensory-deprivation tank."

"You'll want to see this," Cas insisted, tapping her slate. "The payout isn't in credits. It's in *freedom*."

Zero walked to the cockpit, the magnetic soles of his boots clicking on the deck. He looked at the screen. The message was simple, text-only, no sender ID.

**CONTRACT: PROJECT NSFW-32**
**OBJECTIVE: ACQUISITION & EXTRACTION**
**TARGET: COGNIS VAULT, DECK 12**
**PAYMENT: DIAMOND-TIER LIABILITY PARDON + 50 MILLION CREDITS**

"Diamond-Tier," Zero whispered. It wasn't just money. It was a corporate pardon. It meant his entire criminal history—every 'Unsanctified' flag, every warrant, every debt—would be wiped from the Cognis servers. It meant he could walk through a sensor gate without triggering a kill-team. It meant he could stop breathing battery acid and buy a life where the air was filtered by trees, not scrubbers.

"Who's the client?" Zero asked, his suspicion spiking.

"Anonymous," Cas said, popping a bubble of gum. "The encryption is 'Pre-Haywire' grade. I can't crack it. That means this isn't some street-level fixer. This is a Tier-1 power player with resources that predate the Mandate."

"It's a trap," Zero said flatly. "Nobody pays that much for a heist unless it's suicide. And 'Pre-Haywire' tech? That screams corporate black-ops."

"It's a Titan," Cas said, pulling up a schematic. "A prototype. The NSFW-32. Rumor is, it cooks every pilot who plugs into it. That's why they need you. They need a Scrapper who runs 'Dirty' tech. Someone who can override the safeties."

Zero looked at the schematic. The machine was a beast—forty feet of matte-black armor and fusion reactors. It looked like a god of war wrapped in industrial chains.

"If we do this," Zero said, "we're done. No more scraping. No more running."

"Exactly," Cas grinned. "We take the money, and we disappear. I've already got a line on a private island on Europa. It has real trees, Zero. Trees that make oxygen, not scrubbers."

Zero looked at his reflection in the dark viewport. The Oni-Menpo mask stared back, a demon of his own making. He was tired of the mask. Tired of the smell of rust and blood.

"Where's the meet?" Zero asked.

"Deck 12," Cas said. "There's a team waiting. A pilot and a heavy. We provide the entry and the trigger."

"A team," Zero scoffed. "I work alone."

"Not for fifty million, you don't," Cas countered. "Besides, the client was specific. 'The Human Trigger' is the key."

Zero felt a chill. That name. It wasn't just a nickname; it was what Silas used to call him before the betrayal. If an anonymous client with military-grade encryption was using that specific term, this wasn't a random job. It was a summons.

"Set a course," Zero said, turning back to the hold. "Let's go see who wants to play god."

The *Scrap-Vulture* docked at the service port of Deck 12 an hour later. The airlock cycled with a hiss of decontamination spray. Zero stepped out, the Lobotomizer strapped to his back, his hand hovering near the hilt.

"I'll stay on the line," Cas said over the Link. "I'm ghosting your signature. To the local grid, you're just a maintenance worker with a really aggressive tool belt."

"Keep your eyes open," Zero said. "If this goes south, dump the core and run."

"Ye of little faith," Cas chirped. "Go make us rich, Samurai."

Zero moved into the corridor. The air here was hotter, thicker. He could hear the distant thrum of riot control measures—flash-bangs and screaming. Deck 12 was already a war zone.

Perfect cover.

He checked his HUD. The rendezvous point was a docking bay on the far side of the riot. He adjusted his mask, the **active scrubbers hissing as the lateral fangs vented superheated, filtered air, clearing the tear gas from his intake.**

"Time to work," Zero whispered.
