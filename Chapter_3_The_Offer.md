# Chapter 3: The Offer

The escape wasn't a run; it was a bleed.

Zero moved through the *Golden Spire's* waste-disposal veins, a labyrinth of pressurized chutes and chemical sluices that stank of ozone and corporate excess. Above him, the alarms were a distant, rhythmic throb, like a headache that wouldn't quit. He could hear the Cleaners moving through the upper ventilation shafts—wet, heavy slaps of carbon-fiber feet hunting for a pulse.

He didn't give them one. He scrambled down a service ladder, his breath misting in the rapidly dropping temperature. He was descending into the building's nervous system, leaving the gilded atrium for the frozen, sterile dark of the data-core.

Zero holed up in Server Node 7, a sub-zero archive room filled with rows of humming backup drives. The cold bit through his flight suit, numbing the chemical burn in his lungs. It was perfect. Thermal optics would struggle to distinguish his body heat from the servers' exhaust vents.

He sat with his back against a rack, the Lobotomizer laid across his knees. He ran a diagnostic on the blade—magnetic containment at 94%. It was leaking heat, singing the deck plating with a faint, violet aura that hissed like a trapped snake. He pulled a rag from his pocket and began to wipe the carbon scoring from the hilt, his hands shaking with a "White Finger" tremor that the cold only made worse.

*Breathe. Wipe. Check.*

"Impressive work in the airlock," a voice echoed from the shadows.

Zero tightened his grip on the hilt, his knuckles whitening through his lead-lined gloves. "Identify," Zero said, his voice flat as the deck plates.

A figure stepped out from the darkness between the server racks. Charcoal suit, Italian cut. Silver augged eyes that whirred softly as they focused. Zero scanned him: high-end Cognis oculars, thermal and kinetic tracking. Subdermal armor weave under the silk suit. This wasn't a grunt; this was management.

"Call me Silas," the man said, smoothing a non-existent crease on his lapel. "And you are Zero Vex. Fugitive. Liability. And currently, my only option."

Zero stood up slowly, the Odachi scraping against the metal floor with a sound like grinding teeth. "I watched you kill them," Zero said, his voice trembling with suppressed rage. "Rook. Kilo. You locked the vault. You sold us out for a Diamond-Tier debt correction."

Silas smiled, a thin expression devoid of humor. "Those were assets, Zero. Depreciating ones. You, however... you improvised. You survived. That makes you a variable I can still use."

"Why aren't you dead?" Zero asked, shifting his weight. "I should cut you in half right now and see if your blood is as silver as your eyes."

"Because I turned the alarm off," Silas said, tapping his temple. "Kill me, and it goes back on. The Viper Squad outside will turn this room into a tomb before your blade clears the lock. I am the only reason you are still breathing."

Zero glanced at his HUD. The threat indicator had turned a benign green.

"I'm the man who reads the spreadsheets," Silas said, stepping closer. "Your friends died because they were obsolete. They relied on 'Sanctified' tech—safe, legal, tethered. You use 'dirty' tech. You are a chaotic variable in a system of constants."

"Get to the point," Zero growled.

"I have a job for you. You are trapped. A 'Ghost' in a locked room. Dead man walking," Silas said. "Unless you do something for me. A 'Debt-Correction'. I can wipe your file, Zero. I can give you enough credits to buy your own moon. No more scavenging for scraps. No more expensive street-doc enzymes for those UV burns."

He tossed Zero a data-chip. Zero caught it, the plastic clicking against his numb palm.

"Project NSFW-32," Silas continued. "A fusion-powered Titan. Prototype class. It rejects standard pilots. Burns out their neural pathways in seconds because they try to follow the Mandate's protocols. It needs a Scrapper. Someone who can jailbreak a soul."

"You want me to pilot your death machine?" Zero asked, turning the chip over.

"I want you to steal it," Silas corrected. "I represent a splinter faction within Cognis. We believe the Mandate has become... stagnant. We want the asset gone. And yes, I am betraying my employers. Again. Consistency is a virtue, Zero."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I reactivate the pylon. And the Viper Squad waiting in the corridor will turn this room into a very cold tomb. They're Gen-Mods, Zero. No neural jacks for you to hack. You'll die tired."

Zero looked at the Lobotomizer. He could kill him. But Silas was right. He was trapped. The math was against him.

He slipped the chip into his pocket. "Where is it?" Zero asked.

"Deck 12. The Vault," Silas said, turning to leave. "Try not to break it. It's worth more than this entire sector."

"I don't do statistics," Zero said to the man's back. "I do salvage."

Silas vanished into the shadows of the server farm. Zero waited a full minute, listening to the hum of the drives, before he looked at the data-chip. He slotted it into his neural deck to verify the coordinates. The schematic for the NSFW-32 scrolled across his HUD—technical specs, fusion output, armor density. But buried in the metadata, underneath the weapon protocols, there was an audio file. Encrypted. Fragmented.

Zero triggered it. A voice cut through the static. Instead of the cold, synthetic tone of a machine, it was soft. Small. A child’s voice, filtered through a million miles of vacuum.

*"...dark... it's so dark in here... is anyone out there? Pilot? ...please..."*

The file corrupted and dissolved into white noise. Zero frowned, ejecting the chip. A glitch? Or something else? He looked at the Lobotomizer, then back at the chip.

"Just a job," he muttered to himself, trying to ignore the chill that had nothing to do with the server room's temperature. "Just salvage."
