# Chapter 3: The Offer

Zero ran the schematics in his head, overlaying the ship’s blueprints on his HUD. He marked the thermal vents, the maintenance shafts, and the blind spots in the sensor grid.

He holed up in Server Node 7, a frozen room filled with backup drives. The cold numbed the burn in his lungs.

He sat with his back against a rack, the Lobotomizer across his knees. He ran a diagnostic on the blade—magnetic containment at 94%. It was leaking heat, singing the deck plating with a faint, violet aura.

"Impressive work in the airlock," a voice said.

Zero tightened his grip on the hilt. "Identify."

A figure stepped out. Charcoal suit, silver augged eyes. Zero scanned him: high-end Mil-Spec oculars, likely thermal and kinetic tracking. Subdermal armor weave under the silk suit.

"Call me Silas," he said. "And you are Zero Vex. Fugitive."

Zero stood up. "I killed three of your goons. You want to make it four?"

Silas smiled. "Those 'goons' were expendable. You improvised. You overcame a Tier-3 ambush with industrial salvage."

He appraised Zero.

"Why aren't you dead?" Zero asked.

"Because I turned the alarm off," Silas said.

Zero glanced at his HUD. Green.

"Who are you?"

"I'm the man who reads the spreadsheets. Your friends died because they were obsolete. They relied on 'Sanctified' tech. You use 'dirty' tech. You are a chaotic variable."

"Get to the point."

"I have a job for you. You are trapped. Dead man walking. Unless you do something for me."

He tossed Zero a data-chip. "Project NS-FW-32. A fusion-powered Titan. It rejects standard pilots. It needs a Scrapper. Someone who can jailbreak a soul."

"You want me to pilot your death machine?"

"I want you to *steal* it. I represent a splinter faction. We want it gone."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I reactivate the alarm."

Zero looked at the katana. He could kill him. But he was right. He was trapped.

He slipped the chip into his pocket. "Where is it?"

"Deck 12. The Vault."

"I don't do statistics," Zero said. "I do salvage."
