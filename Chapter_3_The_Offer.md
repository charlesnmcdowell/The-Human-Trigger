# Chapter 3: The Blind Contract

Zero sat on a crate in the cargo hold of the *Scrap-Vulture*, a rusted transport skimming the smog layer of Sector 4. The adrenaline from the fight was fading, replaced by the dull throb of a headache. He wiped the last of the nosebleed away with the back of his glove, staring at the Cognis core humming on the deck. It was a cylinder of blue light, worth more than the ship they were flying in.

"You okay, Zero?" Cas asked, her voice echoing from the cockpit. "You zoned out for a second there."

"Just a glitch," Zero muttered, shaking his head. The memory of the Helios-7 Spire—of Rook grinning as he died, of Kilo's silence—clung to him like static. It had been three months, but the smell of burnt plastic always brought it back. He forced the ghost of the Flesh-Feed Star out of his mind. That was the past. This was business.

"Well, snap out of it," Cas said. "Because we just got a ping on the Dark-Mesh. Priority One. Encrypted."

Zero frowned. "We just finished a job, Cas. I need a drink and a week in a sensory-deprivation tank."

He grabbed a bulb of synthetic whiskey and walked toward the cockpit. He hadn't bothered to dress down fully; he was shirtless, wearing only his grey thermal boxers. He was in fighting shape—not the steroid-bulk of a heavy, but the lean, corded muscle of a predator that ate twice a day and hunted for a living. His six-pack was defined, his ebony skin scarred but healthy. His long purple locs were braided up into a high, samurai-style ponytail that defied gravity, flowing behind him like a war-banner.

He stepped into the cockpit. It was freezing—Cas liked to keep the servers cool.

Cas spun her chair around. She looked like a relic from a warmer world, her skin a rich, golden-brown that suggested "Terra-Born" ancestry—a mix of Old World islander genetics that stood in stark contrast to the pale, translucent skin of the Europa colony natives. She was short, maybe 5'1", but her proportions were curvy and dangerous. She wore oversized, circular designer glasses that magnified her black, beedy eyes, framed by shoulder-length wavy black hair streaked with dark pink highlights.

She was dressed for comfort, not company. She wore a white tank top emblazoned with a "Neko-Pop" character—a cybernetic kitten with an eyepatch—and a pair of white, high-cut panties that looked like **Gilded-Lily** silk, the kind of expensive brand usually reserved for the wives of Executives. She sat cross-legged, her posture casual, but the cold air of the cockpit had made her nipples visibly erect against the thin cotton of her top.

"It's freezing in here," Zero said, taking a swig of the whiskey. His hazel eyes were intense, piercing, scanning the room with the unblinking, terrifying focus of a sleep-paralysis demon. He noticed the detail on her shirt, the silk, the reaction to the cold—but he didn't break eye contact.

Cas looked him up and down, her gaze lingering on the obvious morning wood pressing against his grey boxers. She smirked, pushing her glasses up her nose.

"I guess you were overcompensating with that sword," she quipped, her voice dry.

Zero didn't blink. He didn't cover up. He just took another drink. "The ping, Cas."

"Right. Anyway, you'll want to see this," Cas said, tapping her slate. "The payout isn't in credits. It's in *freedom*."

Zero leaned over her shoulder, the magnetic soles of his boots clicking on the deck. He looked at the screen. The message was simple, text-only, no sender ID.

**CONTRACT: PROJECT NSFW-32**
**OBJECTIVE: ACQUISITION & EXTRACTION**
**TARGET: COGNIS VAULT, DECK 12**
**PAYMENT: 50 MILLION CREDITS**

"50 million credits," Zero whispered.

He didn't care about the criminal record. Going straight was a slow death sentence. He’d seen the 'law-abiding' citizens of the Sprawl—wage slaves packing dolls into crates, their eyes dead, their bodies failing from malnutrition and stress while they thanked the Corp for the privilege of breathing recycled air. Even the Dolls were 'legal' workers. The system didn't reward obedience; it consumed it.

"Do the math," Zero said, his voice low.

"I already did," Cas said, popping a bubble of gum. "The average Tier-4 employee makes forty-five thousand credits a year. A specialist, maybe a doctor or a mid-level engineer, pulls in a hundred thousand if they sell their likeness rights."

"And they never break two hundred," Zero added. "That kind of wealth doesn't come from labor. It comes from owning things. Owning people."

"At a hundred grand a year," Cas continued, looking at the number on the screen, "it would take you five hundred years to earn this. Five centuries of perfect attendance, zero sick days, and licking the boot every morning."

"We don't have five hundred years," Zero said. "We have maybe five before the radiation in this sector cooks us or a Scrapper gets lucky."

"Exactly," Cas grinned. "We take the money, and we disappear. I've already got a line on a private island on Europa. It has real trees, Zero. Trees that make oxygen, not scrubbers. We buy our way out of the food chain."

"Who's the client?" Zero asked, his eyes narrowing.

"Anonymous," Cas said. "The encryption is 'Pre-Haywire' grade. I can't crack it. That means this isn't some street-level fixer. This is a Tier-1 power player with resources that predate the Mandate."

"It's a trap," Zero said flatly. "Nobody pays that much for a heist unless it's suicide. And 'Pre-Haywire' tech? That screams corporate black-ops."

"A team," Zero scoffed. "I work alone."

"Not for fifty million, you don't," Cas countered. "Besides, the client was specific. 'The Human Trigger' is the key."

Zero felt a chill. That name. It wasn't just a nickname; it was what Silas used to call him before the betrayal. If an anonymous client with military-grade encryption was using that specific term, this wasn't a random job. It was a summons.

"Set a course," Zero said, turning back to the hold. "Let's go see who wants to play god."

The *Scrap-Vulture* docked at the service port of Deck 12 an hour later. The airlock cycled with a hiss of decontamination spray. Zero stepped out, the Lobotomizer strapped to his back, his hand hovering near the hilt.

"I'll stay on the line," Cas said over the Link. "I'm ghosting your signature. To the local grid, you're just a maintenance worker with a really aggressive tool belt."

"Keep your eyes open," Zero said. "If this goes south, dump the core and run."

"Ye of little faith," Cas chirped. "Go make us rich, Samurai."

Zero moved into the corridor. The air here was hotter, thicker. He could hear the distant thrum of riot control measures—flash-bangs and screaming. Deck 12 was already a war zone.

Perfect cover.

He checked his HUD. The rendezvous point was a docking bay on the far side of the riot. He adjusted his mask, the active scrubbers hissing as the lateral fangs vented superheated, filtered air, clearing the tear gas from his intake.

"Time to work," Zero whispered.
