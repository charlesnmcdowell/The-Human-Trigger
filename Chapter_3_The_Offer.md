# Chapter 3: The Offer

Zero holed up in Server Node 7, a sub-zero archive room filled with rows of humming backup drives. The cold bit through his flight suit, numbing the chemical burn in his lungs. It was perfect. Thermal optics would struggle to distinguish his body heat from the servers' exhaust vents.

He sat with his back against a rack, the Lobotomizer laid across his knees. He ran a diagnostic on the blade—magnetic containment at 94%. It was leaking heat, singing the deck plating with a faint, violet aura that hissed like a trapped snake. He pulled a rag from his pocket and began to wipe the carbon scoring from the hilt.

*Breathe. Wipe. Check.*

"Impressive work in the airlock," a voice echoed from the shadows.

Zero didn't jump. He didn't even look up. He tightened his grip on the hilt, his knuckles whitening. "Identify," Zero said, his voice flat.

A figure stepped out from the darkness between the server racks. Charcoal suit, Italian cut. Silver augged eyes that whirred softly as they focused. Zero scanned him: high-end Mil-Spec oculars, likely thermal and kinetic tracking. Subdermal armor weave under the silk suit. This wasn't a grunt; this was management.

"Call me Silas," the man said, smoothing a non-existent crease on his lapel. "And you are Zero Vex. Fugitive. Liability. And currently, my only option."

Zero stood up slowly, the Odachi scraping against the metal floor. "I killed three of your 'Cleaners' back there. You want to make it four?"

Silas smiled, a thin expression devoid of humor. "Those 'Cleaners' were assets. Expensive ones. But you... you improvised. You overcame a Tier-3 ambush with industrial salvage and a reckless disregard for physics. The Accountability Mandate couldn't predict you because you don't follow the logic."

He appraised Zero like one might inspect a used car with a suspicious rattle.

"Why aren't you dead?" Zero asked, shifting his weight to the balls of his feet.

"Because I turned the alarm off," Silas said, tapping his temple. "Cognis security protocols are designed to stop intruders. I simply reclassified you as 'maintenance'."

Zero glanced at his HUD. The threat indicator had turned a benign green.

"Who are you?" Zero asked, lowering the blade an inch.

"I'm the man who reads the spreadsheets," Silas said. "Your friends died because they were obsolete. They relied on 'Sanctified' tech—safe, legal, tethered. You use 'dirty' tech. You are a chaotic variable in a system of constants."

"Get to the point," Zero growled.

"I have a job for you. You are trapped. A 'Ghost' in a locked room. Dead man walking," Silas said, stepping closer. "Unless you do something for me. A 'Debt-Correction'. I can wipe your file, Zero. I can upgrade your status from 'Ghost' to **Platinum**. Real medical coverage. No more expensive street-doc enzymes."

He tossed Zero a data-chip. Zero caught it with his off-hand.

"Project NSFW-32," Silas continued. "A fusion-powered Titan. Prototype class. It rejects standard pilots. Burns out their neural pathways in seconds. It needs a Scrapper. Someone who can jailbreak a soul."

"You want me to pilot your death machine?" Zero asked, turning the chip over in his fingers.

"I want you to *steal* it," Silas corrected. "I represent a splinter faction within Cognis. We believe the Mandate has become... stagnant. We want the asset gone."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I reactivate the alarm. And the Viper Squad waiting in the corridor will turn this room into a very cold tomb. They're Gen-Mods, Zero. They don't have neural jacks for you to hack. You'll die tired."

Zero looked at the Lobotomizer. He could kill him. He could cross the distance in two steps and cleave him in half. But Silas was right. He was trapped. The math was against him.

He slipped the chip into his pocket. "Where is it?" Zero asked.

"Deck 12. The Vault," Silas said, turning to leave. "Try not to break it. It's worth more than this entire sector."

"I don't do statistics," Zero said to the man's back. "I do salvage."
