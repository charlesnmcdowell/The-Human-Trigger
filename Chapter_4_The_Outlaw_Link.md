# Chapter 4: The Outlaw Link

Deck 12 was a war zone. Corporate security engaging a riot of indentured crew.

"Chaos is a ladder," Zero whispered, dropping from the vent.

He reached the rendezvous point. A docking bay airlock, welded shut. He ignited the Lobotomizer. *SNAKT.* The plasma edge chewed through the mag-locks, casting a sick purple light against the walls.

He kicked the door in.

The bay was massive, dominated by the *Rusty Nail*. It was an ugly ship, built like a brick and painted like a bruise—mismatched hull plates of rust-brown and industrial grey welded together with more hope than engineering. A giant wearing a massive, articulated "Dread-Plate" exoskeleton sat on a crate near the ramp. The armor was a bulky, industrial-grade monstrosity with exaggerated pauldrons and hazard stripes, making him look like a walking tank that had survived a welding accident. He was eating an apple with a bayonet held in his hydraulic claw arm.

"You're late," the giant said, his voice rumbling from the armor's external speakers. "You smell like ozone."

"I had a disagreement with a door. You Jax?"

"Depends. You the Pilot?"

"I'm the guy with the sword."

Jax grinned, a slow tectonic shift of scarred skin. "Val's inside."

Zero walked up the ramp. The interior of the ship smelled of engine grease, stale coffee, and ozone. Cables snaked along the ceiling like exposed veins, and the deck plating vibrated with the idle hum of a reactor that sounded like it needed a tune-up.

In the cockpit, a woman in a flight suit sat with her back to him, her fingers flying across a holographic nav-console.

"Don't touch anything," she said, her voice sharp. "Wipe your feet. I just scrubbed the deck."

"You must be Val."

She spun around. Sharp features, military posture, hair pulled back in a severe bun. She looked like she belonged on a recruitment poster, not a smuggler's scow. "Valkyrie. Val is for friends. You are cargo."

"I'm the only reason you're getting paid."

"Silas says you're a 'natural.' I say you're a liability. The NSFW-32 is a tomb. The last three pilots who plugged in ended up lobotomized. What makes you think you're special?"

"I don't have to be special," Zero said. "I just have to be desperate."

"Desperation makes you sloppy," Val countered, eyes narrowing. "But we're on a clock. Cas! Are we clear?"

"Clear as a bell, Princess!" Cas chirped from the comms station, blowing a bubble.

"Cas?" Zero blinked.

"In the flesh," she grinned, spinning her chair. She looked out of place in the grim cockpit, surrounded by plushies and empty energy drink cans. "Remote hacking is fun, but the bandwidth here sucks."

"You know him?" Val asked.

"He pays his tabs. Usually."

"Great. Jax! Prep the cargo." Val turned to Zero. "The Asset is in the adjacent hold. Wake it up. Don't detonate the core."

Zero walked to the containment hold. The door was massive. He opened it.

It stood there. Forty feet of matte-black armor. A fusion core pulsing blue.

"Hello, beautiful," Zero whispered.

He climbed the gantry to the cockpit. He sat down. The harness locked.

"Initiating sync," Zero said. He plugged the jack into his neural port.

The world went white.
