# Chapter 4: The Outlaw Link

Deck 12 was a war zone. Through the slats of a ventilation grate, Zero watched the chaos unfold. Corporate security—armored in riot-black—was engaging a mob of discarded 'Dolls'. Their service contracts had likely expired, turning them from high-end luxury goods back into refuse. Flash-bangs detonated with bone-shaking concussions, turning the corridor into a strobe-lit nightmare of screaming, porcelain-skinned figures and the staccato bark of suppression rounds.

"Chaos is a ladder," Zero whispered to himself, kicking the grate free. He dropped into the smoke-filled corridor, a ghost in the melee, moving unseen while the security teams focused on beating back the crowd.

He reached the rendezvous point: a docking bay airlock, welded shut. He ignited the Lobotomizer. *SNAKT.* The plasma edge chewed through the mag-locks, casting a sick violet light against the walls. The metal groaned and yielded, molten slag dripping onto his boots, glowing angrily in the vacuum where the heat had nowhere to go.

He kicked the door in.

The bay was massive, dominated by the *Rusty Nail*. It was an ugly ship, built like a brick and painted like a bruise—mismatched hull plates of rust-brown and industrial grey welded together with more hope than engineering. But the giant guarding the ramp demanded Zero's attention.

Jax sat on a crate near the ramp, wearing a massive, articulated "Dread-Plate" exoskeleton. The armor was a bulky, industrial-grade monstrosity with exaggerated pauldrons and hazard stripes, making him look like a walking tank that had survived a welding accident. Hydraulic pistons hissed with every shift of his weight. He was calmly eating an apple with a bayonet held in his hydraulic claw arm.

"You're late," Jax rumbled, his voice amplified by the armor's external speakers. "You smell like **burnt copper**."

"I had a disagreement with a door," Zero said, sheathing the Odachi. "You Jax?"

"Depends," Jax said, taking a crunching bite of the apple. "You the Pilot?"

"I'm the guy with the sword."

Jax grinned, a slow tectonic shift of scarred skin. "Val's inside. Wipe your feet."

Zero walked up the ramp. The interior of the ship assaulted his senses—engine grease, stale coffee, and the sharp tang of **ionized air**. Cables snaked along the ceiling like exposed veins, and the deck plating vibrated with the idle hum of a reactor that sounded like it needed a tune-up.

In the cockpit, a woman in a flight suit sat with her back to him, her fingers flying across a **Ghost-Cast** nav-console.

"Don't touch anything," she said without turning. Her voice was sharp, clipped. "I just scrubbed the deck."

"You must be Val," Zero said.

She spun around. Sharp features, military posture, hair pulled back in a severe bun. She looked like a recruitment poster officer trapped on a smuggler's scow. "Valkyrie. Val is for friends. You are cargo."

"I'm the only reason you're getting paid," Zero countered.

"Silas says you're a 'natural.' I say you're a liability," Val said, her eyes narrowing as she assessed him.

Zero froze. The name hit him harder than a suppression round. His hand instinctively drifted to the hilt of the Odachi. "Silas? The broker is Silas?"

Val didn't flinch. She watched his hand. "He's the one signing the checks. You got a problem with the payroll, take it up with him after we clear the atmosphere. Right now, you're just the key to the lock."

Zero's jaw tightened. It was a trap. It had to be. Silas didn't offer jobs; he offered death sentences. But 50 million credits... and now he was already inside.

"I'm not special," Zero said, his voice cold, releasing the hilt but not relaxing. "I'm just the only one crazy enough to plug a dead man's jack into that chair."

"Desperation makes you sloppy," Val countered. "But we're on a clock. Cas! Are we clear?"

"Clear as a bell, Princess!" Cas chirped from the **Link-Station**, blowing a pink bubble of gum. "This bandwidth is actual trash, though. I'm lagging harder than a gen-one Doll on a **throttled node**."

"Cas?" Zero blinked, recognizing the voice.

"In the flesh," Cas grinned, spinning her chair. She looked out of place in the grim cockpit, surrounded by plushies and empty energy drink cans. Her rig was a chaotic nest of screens and wires. "**Remote-Linking** is fun, but the bandwidth here sucks. Besides, I wanted a front-row seat to the show."

"You knew it was Silas?" Zero asked, his eyes narrowing at her.

"He pays his tabs," Cas shrugged, avoiding his gaze. "Usually. And for fifty million, I'd work for the Devil himself."

"Great. Jax! Prep the cargo," Val commanded, cutting the tension. "Zero, you're up."

Zero walked to the containment hold. The door was massive, reinforced with lead-shielded blast plating. He opened it.

It stood there. Forty feet of matte-black armor, its surface designed to absorb radar and light alike. A fusion core pulsed deep within its chest with a rhythmic blue light that made the hair on Zero's neck stand up. The official designation was etched into the docking clamp: **N.S.F.W.-32**.

"Neural-Sync Functional Weapon," Val said, her voice echoing in the cold hold. "The pinnacle of Cognis's breach of the Mandate. It uses a human soul as a co-processor."

Zero smirked, though the copper taste of the data-hangover was still bitter in his mouth. "N.S.F.W., huh? Suits me. Because if I plug into this thing and it goes south, I’m definitely Not Safe For Work."

"This isn't a joke, Zero," Val snapped. "The last three pilots are currently vegetables in a Diamond-Tier ward. Their brains literally cooked in their skulls."

"Then I'll just have to keep it on a low simmer," Zero muttered.

He climbed the gantry, the heavy Odachi still strapped to his back, clunking against the Titan's obsidian-colored plating. He sat in the pilot's throne—a cradle of needles and cooling gel.

"Initiating sync," Zero said. He pulled the thick, shielded cable from the headrest. The jack was cold and slick with conductive gel. He slammed it into his **cortex-jack** with a wet *shunk*.

The world went white.

It tasted like copper and burning hair. The glare was blinding, like an exploding sun. Zero’s nervous system shrieked as the Neural-Sync handshake bypassed his firewalls and went straight for his marrow.

"Zero! Your neuro-load is redlining! Pull out!" Cas’s voice screamed through the ship’s comms, but it sounded a thousand miles away, muffled by the roar of the Titan's fusion-heart.

Then the noise stopped.

The white faded into a deep, endless indigo. The HUD, buttons, and levers vanished. He simply *felt* the ship. He felt the weight of the *Rusty Nail* beneath him, the vibration of the dock, and the cold, predatory presence of the Viper Squad currently cutting through the airlock.

And in the center of that violet void, he felt the glitch. The small, shivering presence from the data-chip.

"You're loud," the child’s voice whispered, vibrating in his very DNA. "Are you the one Silas promised?"

"I'm the one who's getting us out of here," Zero thought, his phantom limbs finally finding a body that could match their ghost-torque. "Hold on, kid. We're about to make a mess."

The NSFW-32’s primary optics flared a violent, ionizing purple.
