# Chapter 4: The Outlaw Link

Deck 12 was a war zone. Corporate security was engaging a riot of indentured crew, the air thick with tear gas and the staccato bark of suppression rounds.

"Chaos is a ladder," Zero whispered to himself, dropping from the vent.

He reached the rendezvous point: a docking bay airlock, welded shut. He ignited the Lobotomizer. *SNAKT.* The plasma edge chewed through the mag-locks, casting a sick violet light against the walls. The metal groaned and yielded, molten slag dripping onto his boots and cooling instantly in the vacuum-sealed airlock.

He kicked the door in.

The bay was massive, dominated by the *Rusty Nail*. It was an ugly ship, built like a brick and painted like a bruise—mismatched hull plates of rust-brown and industrial grey welded together with more hope than engineering. But what caught Zero's eye wasn't the ship; it was the giant guarding it.

Jax sat on a crate near the ramp, wearing a massive, articulated "Dread-Plate" exoskeleton. The armor was a bulky, industrial-grade monstrosity with exaggerated pauldrons and hazard stripes, making him look like a walking tank that had survived a welding accident. Hydraulic pistons hissed with every shift of his weight. He was calmly eating an apple with a bayonet held in his hydraulic claw arm.

"You're late," Jax rumbled, his voice amplified by the armor's external speakers. "You smell like ozone."

"I had a disagreement with a door," Zero said, sheathing the Odachi. "You Jax?"

"Depends," Jax said, taking a crunching bite of the apple. "You the Pilot?"

"I'm the guy with the sword."

Jax grinned, a slow tectonic shift of scarred skin. "Val's inside. Wipe your feet."

Zero walked up the ramp. The interior of the ship assaulted his senses—engine grease, stale coffee, and the sharp tang of ozone. Cables snaked along the ceiling like exposed veins, and the deck plating vibrated with the idle hum of a reactor that sounded like it needed a tune-up.

In the cockpit, a woman in a flight suit sat with her back to him, her fingers flying across a holographic nav-console.

"Don't touch anything," she said without turning. Her voice was sharp, clipped. "I just scrubbed the deck."

"You must be Val," Zero said.

She spun around. Sharp features, military posture, hair pulled back in a severe bun. She looked like she belonged on a recruitment poster, not a smuggler's scow. "Valkyrie. Val is for friends. You are cargo."

"I'm the only reason you're getting paid," Zero countered.

"Silas says you're a 'natural.' I say you're a liability," Val said, her eyes narrowing as she assessed him. "The NSFW-32 is a tomb. The last three pilots who plugged in ended up lobotomized. Even **Diamond-Tier** neuro-surgery couldn't fix them. What makes you think you're special?"

"I don't have to be special," Zero said. "I just have to be desperate."

"Desperation makes you sloppy," Val countered. "But we're on a clock. Cas! Are we clear?"

"Clear as a bell, Princess!" Cas chirped from the comms station, blowing a pink bubble of gum.

"Cas?" Zero blinked, recognizing the voice.

"In the flesh," Cas grinned, spinning her chair. She looked out of place in the grim cockpit, surrounded by plushies and empty energy drink cans. Her rig was a chaotic nest of screens and wires. "Remote hacking is fun, but the bandwidth here sucks. Besides, I wanted a front-row seat to the show."

"You know him?" Val asked, glancing between them.

"He pays his tabs," Cas said. "Usually."

"Great. Jax! Prep the cargo," Val commanded. She turned to Zero. "The Asset is in the adjacent hold. Wake it up. Don't detonate the core."

Zero walked to the containment hold. The door was massive, reinforced with blast shielding. He opened it.

It stood there. Forty feet of matte-black armor. A fusion core pulsing with a deep, rhythmic blue light. The NSFW-32. The "Not Safe For World."

"Hello, beautiful," Zero whispered.

He climbed the gantry to the cockpit. He sat down, the harness locking over his chest.

"Initiating sync," Zero said. He plugged the jack into his neural port.

The world went white.
