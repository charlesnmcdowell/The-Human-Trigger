# Chapter 4: The Outlaw Link

Getting from the sub-zero silence of the server farm to Deck 12 required a vertical climb through five levels of corporate hell. Zero bypassed the locked elevators, opting for the mag-lev maintenance shafts. The air grew hotter and thicker with every deck he ascended, the sterile chill of the data-core replaced by the copper tang of overheated machinery and the acrid bite of tear gas.

Deck 12 was a war zone. Through the slats of a ventilation grate, Zero watched the chaos unfold. Corporate security—armored in riot-black—was engaging a mob of indentured crew. Flash-bangs detonated with bone-shaking concussions, turning the corridor into a strobe-lit nightmare of screaming workers and the staccato bark of suppression rounds.

"Chaos is a ladder," Zero whispered to himself, kicking the grate free. He dropped into the smoke-filled corridor, a ghost in the melee, moving unseen while the security teams focused on beating back the crowd.

He reached the rendezvous point: a docking bay airlock, welded shut. He ignited the Lobotomizer. *SNAKT.* The plasma edge chewed through the mag-locks, casting a sick violet light against the walls. The metal groaned and yielded, molten slag dripping onto his boots and cooling instantly in the vacuum-sealed airlock.

He kicked the door in.

The bay was massive, dominated by the *Rusty Nail*. It was an ugly ship, built like a brick and painted like a bruise—mismatched hull plates of rust-brown and industrial grey welded together with more hope than engineering. But what caught Zero's eye wasn't the ship; it was the giant guarding it.

Jax sat on a crate near the ramp, wearing a massive, articulated "Dread-Plate" exoskeleton. The armor was a bulky, industrial-grade monstrosity with exaggerated pauldrons and hazard stripes, making him look like a walking tank that had survived a welding accident. Hydraulic pistons hissed with every shift of his weight. He was calmly eating an apple with a bayonet held in his hydraulic claw arm.

"You're late," Jax rumbled, his voice amplified by the armor's external speakers. "You smell like ozone."

"I had a disagreement with a door," Zero said, sheathing the Odachi. "You Jax?"

"Depends," Jax said, taking a crunching bite of the apple. "You the Pilot?"

"I'm the guy with the sword."

Jax grinned, a slow tectonic shift of scarred skin. "Val's inside. Wipe your feet."

Zero walked up the ramp. The interior of the ship assaulted his senses—engine grease, stale coffee, and the sharp tang of ozone. Cables snaked along the ceiling like exposed veins, and the deck plating vibrated with the idle hum of a reactor that sounded like it needed a tune-up.

In the cockpit, a woman in a flight suit sat with her back to him, her fingers flying across a holographic nav-console.

"Don't touch anything," she said without turning. Her voice was sharp, clipped. "I just scrubbed the deck."

"You must be Val," Zero said.

She spun around. Sharp features, military posture, hair pulled back in a severe bun. She looked like she belonged on a recruitment poster, not a smuggler's scow. "Valkyrie. Val is for friends. You are cargo."

"I'm the only reason you're getting paid," Zero countered.

"Silas says you're a 'natural.' I say you're a liability," Val said, her eyes narrowing as she assessed him.

"I don't have to be special," Zero said. "I just have to be desperate."

"Desperation makes you sloppy," Val countered. "But we're on a clock. Cas! Are we clear?"

"Clear as a bell, Princess!" Cas chirped from the comms station, blowing a pink bubble of gum.

"Cas?" Zero blinked, recognizing the voice.

"In the flesh," Cas grinned, spinning her chair. She looked out of place in the grim cockpit, surrounded by plushies and empty energy drink cans. Her rig was a chaotic nest of screens and wires. "Remote hacking is fun, but the bandwidth here sucks. Besides, I wanted a front-row seat to the show."

"You know him?" Val asked, glancing between them.

"He pays his tabs," Cas said. "Usually."

"Great. Jax! Prep the cargo," Val commanded. "Zero, you're up."

Zero walked to the containment hold. The door was massive, reinforced with lead-shielded blast plating. He opened it.

It stood there. Forty feet of matte-black armor, its surface designed to absorb radar and light alike. A fusion core pulsed deep within its chest with a rhythmic blue light that made the hair on Zero's neck stand up. The official designation was etched into the docking clamp: **N.S.F.W.-32**.

"Neural-Sync Functional Weapon," Val said, her voice echoing in the cold hold. "The pinnacle of Cognis's breach of the Mandate. It doesn't just use a human trigger; it uses a human soul as a co-processor."

Zero smirked, though the copper taste of the data-hangover was still bitter in his mouth. "N.S.F.W., huh? Suits me. Because if I plug into this thing and it goes south, I’m definitely Not Safe For Work."

"This isn't a joke, Zero," Val snapped. "The last three pilots are currently vegetables in a Diamond-Tier ward. Their brains literally cooked in their skulls."

"Then I'll just have to keep it on a low simmer," Zero muttered.

He climbed the gantry, the heavy Odachi still strapped to his back, clunking against the Titan's obsidian-colored plating. He sat in the pilot's throne—a cradle of needles and cooling gel.

"Initiating sync," Zero said. He pulled the thick, shielded cable from the headrest and slammed it into his neural port.

The world went white.

The glare was blinding, like an exploding sun. Zero’s nervous system shrieked as the Neural-Sync handshake bypassed his firewalls and went straight for his marrow.

"Zero! Your neuro-load is redlining! Pull out!" Cas’s voice screamed through the ship’s comms, but it sounded a thousand miles away, muffled by the roar of the Titan's fusion-heart.

Then the noise stopped.

The white faded into a deep, endless violet. The HUD, buttons, and levers vanished. He simply *felt* the ship. He felt the weight of the *Rusty Nail* beneath him, the vibration of the dock, and the cold, predatory presence of the Viper Squad currently cutting through the airlock.

And in the center of that violet void, he felt the glitch. The small, shivering presence from the data-chip.

"You're loud," the child’s voice whispered, vibrating in his very DNA. "Are you the one Silas promised?"

"I'm the one who's getting us out of here," Zero thought, his "White Finger" tremor finally stilled by the massive power flowing through his phantom limbs. "Hold on, kid. We're about to make a mess."

The NSFW-32’s primary optics flared—not blue, but a violent, ionizing violet.
