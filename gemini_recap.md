# Chapter 1: The Scrapper’s Flow
The blade Zero called 'The Lobotomizer' hungry-growled against the magnetic lock of the saya. It was an Odachi—a massive, two-handed field sword with a blade length that bordered on the suicidal. Zero felt the vibration in his molars, a violet-hot itch demanding to be scratched. His hands suffered from "White Finger"—a permanent, low-level tremor caused by the unshielded magnetic induction coils lining the blade's spine.

Sector 4 smelled of sulfur and wet rust—the scent of a ship dying slowly. It was an abandoned hydroponics bay, the walls slick with black mold that ate radiation and bled sludge onto the deck plates. Below Zero, the Centurion-class enforcement bot prowled through the overgrown, rotting vines like a metallic panther. The Cognis logo—a stylized eye trapped in a crosshair—gleamed on its chassis under the flicker of dying emergency lights.

Zero checked his thermal readout. 98%. The unshielded plasma edge would burn at 3,000 Kelvin. Far from corporate-standard, this was a piece of industrial salvage he'd stripped of every limiter that kept a user from being cooked alive by their own weapon. He was here for one thing: the payout. The Class-4 Micro-Fusion Cell beating inside the bot’s chest contained enough refined Helium-3 to power a slum-sector for a month. A mid-level fixer for the Void-Sharks had put a bounty on these specific cores—likely to retrofit their aging fleet of scavenged ships. They didn't ask questions about where the hardware came from, which made them Zero's favorite kind of client.

His pulse hammered against his ribs. He prepared the Logic-Bomb in his neural deck.

"Heads up, Samurai," Cas's voice chirped in his ear, overlaying the bot's schematic on his HUD. "I spent three weeks decrypting their patrol algorithms to find this gap, so try not to waste my time. That's a Centurion Mark-IV. Manufactured by Cognis Heavy Industries. Retail price: more than your entire life's earnings. Their firewall is 'Sanctified' grade, meaning it phones home to the corporate servers every 0.4 seconds to check if it has permission to kill you. Don't let it make that call."

"Sanctified Grade? I doubt anything's angelic about their tech. Alright, Cognis," Zero whispered, tapping his temple where the illegal jack sat. "Let's see how your servers like a recursive paradox."

"Sanctified means it's 'Soul-Verified', genius," Cas corrected, her voice dripping with mock-patience. "It means that hunk of metal has a real-time handshake with the central servers. It's the Accountability Mandate in action—no trigger pulls without a verified human soul on the other end to take the legal rap. But you're about to clog that handshake with junk data, aren't you? A 'Logic-Bomb'. It's going to panic the weapon. It'll stall, waiting for an authorization that you're currently DDoSing into oblivion."

Zero was perched on a rusted catwalk twenty feet above the kill-zone, the metal grating biting into his knees. Below him, the Centurion's sensors swept the hydroponics bay in a fan of hard light, illuminating the rotting vines and the black sludge bleeding from the walls. The air was thick with humidity and the smell of ozone. Zero tightened his grip on the railing, his knuckles white under the lead-lined gloves. Hopping onto the railing with perfect balance he peered down at the massive bot. 

*Breathe. Sync. Drop.*

He tipped forward, dropping face-first into the void. Gravity took the lead, wind whipping his purple locs back like a kinetic contrail. Mid-air, he visualized the local mesh—a chaotic web of RF handshakes tethering the Centurion to the Cognis overmind. He twisted, flipping 180 degrees to drive the Lobotomizer into the bulkhead wall.

The blade shrieked as its magnetic field bit into the metal, slowing his fall in a shower of sparks. Simultaneously, he channeled the Logic-Bomb through the sword’s unshielded coils, using the weapon as a broadcast antenna to blast the bot's receiver with a petabyte of recursive junk data. The neural feedback hit him instantly—a copper taste flooding his mouth and a sharp, blinding spike behind his eyes. A "Data-Hangover" in the making.

He hit the deck plates with a magnetic *thud* that shook the dust from the air. The Centurion swiveled instantly, its single optic eye contracting from search-yellow to kill-purple.

"Unauthorized bio-sig. Handshake failed. Attempting reconnect to Cognis Control..."

"You won't find them," Zero muttered, wiping blood from his nose. "I just DDoSed your soul."

The bot’s Gatling arm spun up, but the firing mechanism hesitated, cycling through error codes. Zero dropped his center of gravity. He used the heavy, lead-lined sheath as a shield, deflecting the bot's swinging limb. The impact rattled his teeth, the magnetic drag of the bot's frame pulling at the metal of his sheath.

"Get off me," Zero grunted.

He twisted his hips. The Centurion matched him, its massive pincer clamping onto his shoulder. Metal groaned against the armor-weave of his kimono. He leaned into the grip, driving his elbow into the bot's optical sensor. Glass shattered.

He triggered the release.

SNAKT.

The Lobotomizer cleared the sheath, and the hydroponics bay turned into an ultraviolet hellscape. The air delaminated, blistering under the heat. The five-foot blade shrieked at 140 decibels, the sound of the staged induction coils fighting to keep the plasma edge from expanding and consuming Zero himself. A violent, ionizing violet light erupted from the oversized steel, casting harsh, jagged shadows.

Zero swung the massive weapon, steering a five-foot high-voltage arc. As the blade moved, it left a "plasma-wake" in the air—a shimmering trail of violet ozone that stayed burned into the retinas.

He drove the blade upward. The Lobotomizer boiled through the bot’s waist with no resistance, only the sound of high-pressure hydraulic fluid flash-vaporizing into a toxic, purple mist. The thermal bloom was so intense that the deck plates beneath the bot’s feet began to slag, turning red-hot in a perfect semi-circle.

Momentum carried him past the ruin. He came up in a crouch, his skin prickling from the UV radiation bleeding off the unshielded blade—a nasty sunburn he'd feel for days. The heat-sinks on the sword's hilt glowed a dull, angry orange.

The Centurion stood there, its optic flickering as the Logic-Bomb finally bricked its higher functions. The top half slid slowly to the left and hit the floor with a wet, metallic thud.

Silence rushed back into the corridor, ringing in Zero's deafened ears.

Zero tapped his comms bead. "Cas. Tell me you got the money shot."

"Got it? Escrow released. The funds are already bouncing through three shell accounts," Cas’s voice crackled. "But seriously, Zero? A frontal assault? We've been running these ops for two years, and you still fight like you have **Diamond-Tier coverage**."

"If I had Diamond coverage, I'd have a backup clone on standby," Zero quipped, wincing as he popped the seal on a stim-injector. "And he'd probably be smarter than me."

"He'd definitely be better looking," Cas shot back. "But the point stands. If you were **Platinum**, an armed extraction team would be dropping in to stabilize your vitals right now. Out here? We rely on 'CRISPR-Cascade' hacks. Sure, the post-war breakthrough made printing a bio-matched liver cheap enough for any basement butcher with a vat, but scrubbing *this* much acute radiation? That requires synthetic DNA-repair enzymes, and those aren't cheap. Freedom is expensive, Samurai."

"If that bot was running the new patch, I'd be a smear on the wall," Zero muttered, slapping the cooling catch on his hilt. He knelt by the ruined chassis, his vibro-knife working to pry the glowing fusion cell from its housing. "So, are we rich yet?"

"Solvent for forty-eight hours. Now move, Samurai. The heat just spiked. Viper Squad signature on long-range."

Zero sprinted, the violet afterimage of the kill still burning in his eyes, his hands shaking from the feedback of a weapon that was as much a meltdown as it was a blade.

# Chapter 2: The Meat Grinder

The memory tasted of sulfur and ozone, a phantom sting that bit harder than the Sector 4 vents. Zero watched the bot’s cooling fluids pool on the deck plates and saw Rook’s blood instead.

"You’re grinding the rail again, Zero," Rook had said. He was leaning against the airlock of the *High-Roller*, buffing the white ceramic finish of a Cognis smart-carbine with a piece of silk. "You’ll polish that steel into a needle before we even dock."

Zero didn't stop the rhythmic scrape of the whetstone. "The magnetic track on the saya has a three-millisecond delay. If the handshake fails, I need the friction to be zero. I don't trust the magnets. I don't trust the ship. And I definitely don't trust that bone-white toy in your lap."

Rook tapped the glowing green 'Sanctified' seal on the carbine’s receiver. It pulsed with a rhythmic, haptic beat—a "digital heartbeat" synced to his own. "It feels me, Zero. The Human Trigger. Cognis engineering says this tracks a heartbeat through a meter of reinforced concrete. To me, it's a lullaby. No AI. Just my intent, amplified. This job is my ticket to **Platinum Status**, Zero. Real medical coverage. A future."

"It’s the Accountability Mandate, Rook," Zero said, looking up. The whetstone went silent. "That digital heartbeat is the sound of a ticking clock. The 'law' is a line of code in a Cognis server. That gun is a leash. The Human Trigger wasn't meant to empower you; it was meant to monitor you. If Cognis decides your pulse is a liability, that weapon bricks. It’s not yours. It’s theirs."

"Then it’s a good thing we’re the best contractors they’ve got," Kilo called out from the back, her hands buried in the guts of a thermite charge. "Silas, tell the boy the math. He’s making me nervous with that 'doomsday' talk."

Silas didn't turn from the pilot’s console. He sat rigid, his eyes glazed in the milky-white sheen of a deep-data trance. Unlike the others, Silas was a "Pure," his brain genetically tuned for data-processing rather than augmented with chips. "The route is verified. The vault's security mesh is on a sub-routine loop. There are no variables, Zero. Only the payout."

"There’s always a variable," Zero muttered. He slid the Lobotomizer into the saya. *SNAKT.* The magnetic lock caught with a heavy, industrial thud.

The transition to the *Golden Spire* was a blur of pressurized steam and the metallic tang of recycled air. They moved through the corridors like shadows—until they hit the vault threshold. The world didn't explode. It went silent.

Rook screamed as the weapon let out a pathetic, electronic whine. The green seal turned a jagged, pulsing red. The Cognis firmware didn't just lock the firing pin; it dumped the entire thermal load of the power cell into the cooling vents at once. The white ceramic turned a scorching, blister-inducing black in Rook's hands. He wasn't holding a club; he was holding a localized meltdown designed to maim the "unauthorized."

"My HUD," Rook gasped, stumbling as his targeting optics—linked to the carbine's sensors—dissolved into grey static. "I’m blind! The Mandate... it’s revoking my permissions!"

"Abort!" Zero screamed, but the comms were dead.

"The math changed, Rook," Silas’s voice echoed once over the emergency channel, sounding thin and far away. "Cognis offered a **Diamond-Tier** Debt-Correction. A clean slate for my family. I’m just balancing the ledger."

Then the ceiling vents hissed open.

The 'Cleaners' unfolded from the vents with a terrifying, frictionless grace—no hydraulic hiss, no mechanical whine. Just the wet, heavy slap of bare, carbon-grafted feet on the deck plates. They were silent hunters in a world of screaming machines. Seven-foot-tall biological anomalies fueled by synthetic hemoglobin and skin grafted with sub-dermal carbon mesh. No cybernetics. No hackable limbs. Just raw, genetically-perfected violence.

A flechette burst caught Rook in the chest. Without his armor's active-integrity fields—which had also bricked—the ceramic plates shattered like glass. The needles turned his torso into a spray of red mist. Kilo didn't even scream; a sniper round from the high gallery—Silas’s perch—took her before she could touch the det-cord.

Zero stood in the center of the slaughter. A Cleaner turned toward him, its unnaturally pale eyes tracking him with the cold focus of a predator. It raised a sidearm, the barrel spinning up.

Zero leaned into the "Flow." He slammed his mind into the room's mesh, dropping a Logic-Bomb that forced a recursive handshake error on the Cleaner's weapon. The sidearm groaned, its Cognis firmware locking the trigger in a safety-loop.

The Cleaner didn't panic. It dropped the gun and reached for a combat knife, its genetically-enhanced muscles coiling like high-tension cables. It was faster than any human, but it was a close-quarters predator. It needed to be within three feet to end him.

Zero had five.

He pivoted, the Lobotomizer clearing the saya in a massive, horizontal sweep. The five-foot arc of violet plasma created a literal "no-man's land." The Cleaner tried to change its vector mid-air, its hyper-reflexes screaming, but the Odachi’s reach was an inescapable geometric fact.

The blade boiled through the sub-dermal mesh and the heart beneath. The Cleaner’s synthetic blood didn't spray—it turned into a toxic, purple steam the moment it hit the ionizing edge.

The violet glow reflected in the pooling blood, a jagged neon scar. The skin on Zero's forearms prickled and reddened—instant UV burns from the dirty blade.

Rook had wanted a legacy. He’d found a ledger instead.

# Chapter 3: The Offer

Zero holed up in Server Node 7, a sub-zero archive room filled with rows of humming backup drives. The cold bit through his flight suit, numbing the chemical burn in his lungs. It was perfect. Thermal optics would struggle to distinguish his body heat from the servers' exhaust vents.

He sat with his back against a rack, the Lobotomizer laid across his knees. He ran a diagnostic on the blade—magnetic containment at 94%. It was leaking heat, singing the deck plating with a faint, violet aura that hissed like a trapped snake. He pulled a rag from his pocket and began to wipe the carbon scoring from the hilt.

*Breathe. Wipe. Check.*

"Impressive work in the airlock," a voice echoed from the shadows.

Zero didn't jump. He didn't even look up. He tightened his grip on the hilt, his knuckles whitening. "Identify," Zero said, his voice flat.

A figure stepped out from the darkness between the server racks. Charcoal suit, Italian cut. Silver augged eyes that whirred softly as they focused. Zero scanned him: high-end Mil-Spec oculars, likely thermal and kinetic tracking. Subdermal armor weave under the silk suit. This wasn't a grunt; this was management.

"Call me Silas," the man said, smoothing a non-existent crease on his lapel. "And you are Zero Vex. Fugitive. Liability. And currently, my only option."

Zero stood up slowly, the Odachi scraping against the metal floor. "I killed three of your 'Cleaners' back there. You want to make it four?"

Silas smiled, a thin expression devoid of humor. "Those 'Cleaners' were assets. Expensive ones. But you... you improvised. You overcame a Tier-3 ambush with industrial salvage and a reckless disregard for physics. The Accountability Mandate couldn't predict you because you don't follow the logic."

He appraised Zero like one might inspect a used car with a suspicious rattle.

"Why aren't you dead?" Zero asked, shifting his weight to the balls of his feet.

"Because I turned the alarm off," Silas said, tapping his temple. "Cognis security protocols are designed to stop intruders. I simply reclassified you as 'maintenance'."

Zero glanced at his HUD. The threat indicator had turned a benign green.

"Who are you?" Zero asked, lowering the blade an inch.

"I'm the man who reads the spreadsheets," Silas said. "Your friends died because they were obsolete. They relied on 'Sanctified' tech—safe, legal, tethered. You use 'dirty' tech. You are a chaotic variable in a system of constants."

"Get to the point," Zero growled.

"I have a job for you. You are trapped. A 'Ghost' in a locked room. Dead man walking," Silas said, stepping closer. "Unless you do something for me. A 'Debt-Correction'. I can wipe your file, Zero. I can upgrade your status from 'Ghost' to **Platinum**. Real medical coverage. No more expensive street-doc enzymes."

He tossed Zero a data-chip. Zero caught it with his off-hand.

"Project NSFW-32," Silas continued. "A fusion-powered Titan. Prototype class. It rejects standard pilots. Burns out their neural pathways in seconds. It needs a Scrapper. Someone who can jailbreak a soul."

"You want me to pilot your death machine?" Zero asked, turning the chip over in his fingers.

"I want you to *steal* it," Silas corrected. "I represent a splinter faction within Cognis. We believe the Mandate has become... stagnant. We want the asset gone."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I reactivate the alarm. And the Viper Squad waiting in the corridor will turn this room into a very cold tomb. They're Gen-Mods, Zero. They don't have neural jacks for you to hack. You'll die tired."

Zero looked at the Lobotomizer. He could kill him. He could cross the distance in two steps and cleave him in half. But Silas was right. He was trapped. The math was against him.

He slipped the chip into his pocket. "Where is it?" Zero asked.

"Deck 12. The Vault," Silas said, turning to leave. "Try not to break it. It's worth more than this entire sector."

"I don't do statistics," Zero said to the man's back. "I do salvage."

# Chapter 4: The Outlaw Link

Deck 12 was a war zone. Corporate security was engaging a riot of indentured crew, the air thick with tear gas and the staccato bark of suppression rounds.

"Chaos is a ladder," Zero whispered to himself, dropping from the vent.

He reached the rendezvous point: a docking bay airlock, welded shut. He ignited the Lobotomizer. *SNAKT.* The plasma edge chewed through the mag-locks, casting a sick violet light against the walls. The metal groaned and yielded, molten slag dripping onto his boots and cooling instantly in the vacuum-sealed airlock.

He kicked the door in.

The bay was massive, dominated by the *Rusty Nail*. It was an ugly ship, built like a brick and painted like a bruise—mismatched hull plates of rust-brown and industrial grey welded together with more hope than engineering. But what caught Zero's eye wasn't the ship; it was the giant guarding it.

Jax sat on a crate near the ramp, wearing a massive, articulated "Dread-Plate" exoskeleton. The armor was a bulky, industrial-grade monstrosity with exaggerated pauldrons and hazard stripes, making him look like a walking tank that had survived a welding accident. Hydraulic pistons hissed with every shift of his weight. He was calmly eating an apple with a bayonet held in his hydraulic claw arm.

"You're late," Jax rumbled, his voice amplified by the armor's external speakers. "You smell like ozone."

"I had a disagreement with a door," Zero said, sheathing the Odachi. "You Jax?"

"Depends," Jax said, taking a crunching bite of the apple. "You the Pilot?"

"I'm the guy with the sword."

Jax grinned, a slow tectonic shift of scarred skin. "Val's inside. Wipe your feet."

Zero walked up the ramp. The interior of the ship assaulted his senses—engine grease, stale coffee, and the sharp tang of ozone. Cables snaked along the ceiling like exposed veins, and the deck plating vibrated with the idle hum of a reactor that sounded like it needed a tune-up.

In the cockpit, a woman in a flight suit sat with her back to him, her fingers flying across a holographic nav-console.

"Don't touch anything," she said without turning. Her voice was sharp, clipped. "I just scrubbed the deck."

"You must be Val," Zero said.

She spun around. Sharp features, military posture, hair pulled back in a severe bun. She looked like she belonged on a recruitment poster, not a smuggler's scow. "Valkyrie. Val is for friends. You are cargo."

"I'm the only reason you're getting paid," Zero countered.

"Silas says you're a 'natural.' I say you're a liability," Val said, her eyes narrowing as she assessed him. "The NSFW-32 is a tomb. The last three pilots who plugged in ended up lobotomized. Even **Diamond-Tier** neuro-surgery couldn't fix them. What makes you think you're special?"

"I don't have to be special," Zero said. "I just have to be desperate."

"Desperation makes you sloppy," Val countered. "But we're on a clock. Cas! Are we clear?"

"Clear as a bell, Princess!" Cas chirped from the comms station, blowing a pink bubble of gum.

"Cas?" Zero blinked, recognizing the voice.

"In the flesh," Cas grinned, spinning her chair. She looked out of place in the grim cockpit, surrounded by plushies and empty energy drink cans. Her rig was a chaotic nest of screens and wires. "Remote hacking is fun, but the bandwidth here sucks. Besides, I wanted a front-row seat to the show."

"You know him?" Val asked, glancing between them.

"He pays his tabs," Cas said. "Usually."

"Great. Jax! Prep the cargo," Val commanded. She turned to Zero. "The Asset is in the adjacent hold. Wake it up. Don't detonate the core."

Zero walked to the containment hold. The door was massive, reinforced with blast shielding. He opened it.

It stood there. Forty feet of matte-black armor. A fusion core pulsing with a deep, rhythmic blue light. The NSFW-32. The "Not Safe For World."

"Hello, beautiful," Zero whispered.

He climbed the gantry to the cockpit. He sat down, the harness locking over his chest.

"Initiating sync," Zero said. He plugged the jack into his neural port.

The world went white.

# Chapter 5: The Haywire Graveyard

The white light of the neural sync collapsed into the jagged static of a rejected handshake. The AI didn't speak; it screamed, a digital shriek tearing through Zero's frontal lobe.

*// UNRECOGNIZED USER. PURGE PROTOCOL INITIATED. //*

"Denied," Zero gritted out, his teeth clenched against the phantom pain of his synapses misfiring. It felt like trying to download a **Diamond-Tier** connectome through a copper wire. "Handshake override."

*// AUTHORIZATION INVALID. BIOMETRIC MISMATCH. //*

The mech was trying to cook his brain. It wasn't designed for a human mind; it was designed to consume one. Zero fought the code with *feeling*, visualizing the radioactive sludge of the Scrap-Vats, the chaotic rhythm of the Flow. He didn't ask for permission; he forced his consciousness into the machine's architecture like a pry-bar.

*// ANOMALY DETECTED. SYNC ESTABLISHED. //*

His eyes snapped open. He wasn't sitting in a cockpit anymore. He *was* the Titan. He felt the fusion core beating in his chest, the hydraulic fluid pumping through his veins, the thick armor plating serving as a second skin.

"Green board," Zero said, his voice echoing in the metallic skull of the machine.

"We've got company," Val's voice crackled over the comms, sharp and urgent. "Corporate security is breaching the bay doors. Move the Asset!"

Zero willed the machine forward. The NSFW-32 moved with a heavy, terrifying grace. He stepped out of the containment hold just as a squad of Centurions formed a firing line.

"Hades," Zero whispered, tasting the name. "Let's dance."

He drew the fusion blade. It was a skyscraper of sharpened tungsten wrapped in a containment field, humming with the power of a small star.

The Centurions opened fire. Bullets sparked harmlessly off his matte-black hull, buzzing like angry flies.

Zero moved. The Scrapper’s Flow translated perfectly through the neural link. He didn't plod like a tank; he sidestepped a rocket with the agility of a duelist and brought the massive blade down in a thunderous arc. The deck plating split with a scream of tearing metal. The Centurions didn't just break; they evaporated in the thermal wash.

"Holy..." Jax breathed over the channel.

"Asset secured," Zero said. He engaged the jump-jets, the sudden g-force slamming him into the pilot's couch as the Titan launched itself onto the cargo ramp of the *Rusty Nail*.

"Punching it!" Val yelled.

The ship lurched, fusion drives screaming as they blasted out of the dock and into the void.

***

The *Rusty Nail* cut its main torch, drifting into the shadow of the **Haywire Graveyard**, a radioactive reef of shattered warships and orbital debris. It was a place where sensors went to die and ghosts came to hide.

"We need to calibrate," Zero said, his voice sounding thin in the quiet cockpit. "Hades is running hot."

He walked the Titan onto the hull of a derelict dreadnought, the magnetic clamps in the mech's feet locking onto the rusted iron. He dove deep into the code, burning through safety protocols with his mind, stripping away the limiters that Cognis had installed.

*// WARNING. CORE INTEGRITY AT RISK. //*

"Trust me," Zero whispered to the machine.

He pushed the core to the redline, feeling the heat bleed into the cockpit.

*// SYNCHRONIZATION: 120%. //*

A warning klaxon blared in the ship's cockpit.

"Proximity alert!" Cas yelled. "Contacts emerging from the debris!"

Three Void-Shark skiffs drifted out of the shadows, their jagged hulls painted with tribal warnings. Scavengers. Bottom feeders.

"Live-fire exercise," Zero said, the fusion blade igniting with a snap-hiss that vibrated through the hull.

# Chapter 6: The Ghost in the Machine

The Void-Sharks didn't fight like soldiers; they fought like piranhas. The three skiffs accelerated, their plasma cannons lighting up the gloom of the graveyard.

"Contacts!" Val called out, her hands flying across the pilot's console. "Jax, man the dorsal turrets. Cas, jam their comms. I don't want them calling for backup."

"On it," Cas chirped, her fingers dancing over her chaotic rig. "Deploying electronic countermeasures. Let's give them some static."

Zero stood on the hull of the dreadnought, the Titan a massive silhouette against the starlight. The skiffs strafed the *Rusty Nail*, their shots splashing against the ship's shields.

He locked onto the lead skiff. "Hades. Target solution."

*// PROBABILITY OF INTERCEPT: 94%. //*

Zero didn't wait. He grabbed a massive, loose bulkhead plate from the dreadnought's surface—a slab of iron the size of a bus—and hurled it. The improvised projectile spun through the void, colliding with the lead skiff's engine block. The ship sheared in half, blossoming into a silent fireball.

"One down," Zero noted.

The other two skiffs turned their attention to the Titan. Plasma bolts boiled against his magnetic deflectors, rocking the mech.

Zero activated the jump-jets. He launched from the dreadnought, soaring through the vacuum. He landed on a drifting asteroid, used it as a springboard, and ignited the fusion blade mid-flight. He became a kinetic missile, closing the distance before the pirates could track his vector.

He cut the second ship in half. The tungsten blade met no resistance. Debris and atmosphere vented into space, freezing instantly.

The third skiff didn't stick around. It fired its thrusters, vanishing into the dense debris field.

Zero returned to the *Rusty Nail*, the adrenaline fading into a dull ache.

***

"Cas," Zero said later, sitting in the mess hall. He rubbed his temples, the phantom weight of the neural link still pressing on his mind. "I found a ghost in the code. Encrypted. Deep in the core."

Cas jacked her deck into the Titan's access port. "This isn't standard Cognis **Sanctified** code. It's Pre-War encryption," she muttered, her eyes darting across her screens. "Nasty stuff. Give me ten minutes."

It took five.

"You need to hear this," Cas said, her voice unusually quiet. She played the audio log.

*"This is Dr. Aris Thorne. I uploaded him. My son. Orion. He's not a weapon. He's a child. They wanted a targeting computer. I gave them a soul."*

Silence filled the room.

"Orion," Zero whispered. The name felt heavy.

*// DESIGNATION UPDATE: ORION. //* The text scrolled across Cas's screen.

"We just stole a kid," Cas whispered, looking up at Zero.

"We keep this secret," Zero said, glancing at the door where Val was working. "Val is a professional. She might try to return 'The Asset' if she thinks it's the right thing to do. Or if the price is right."

"We keep him," Cas agreed.

# Chapter 7: The Orion-Nex Breach

"We're running on fumes," Jax rumbled, checking the *Rusty Nail*'s diagnostics. "And we're out of protein packs. I can't work on an empty stomach."

"Orion-Nex," Zero said, pulling up a star chart. "It's a Tier-2 Corporate supply depot. Automated. Minimal security."

Jax nodded. "I know it. Weak foundations in the loading bay. I welded those beams myself back in the day."

"I can get us in through a vent," Zero said. "Simple in-and-out."

***

Zero crawled through the tight maintenance shaft, the air stale and metallic. He reached the grate overlooking the warehouse floor and popped it. "I'm in," he whispered over the comms. "Opening bay doors."

Jax moved onto the loading floor, his "Dread-Plate" armor whining under the strain. The massive exoskeleton, with its hazard-striped pauldrons and hydraulic pistons, allowed him to lift pallets that would have crushed a standard forklift. He worked with the rhythmic efficiency of a machine, stacking crates of supplies near the airlock.

Suddenly, the warehouse went black.

*// INTRUDER ALERT. LOCKDOWN INITIATED. //*

Red emergency lights bathed the room in blood.

"Company," Zero hissed, dropping into a combat stance.

**Viper Squad.**

Four figures emerged from the shadows. They moved with an unnatural, fluid grace—no mechanical stiffness, no servo-whine. They wore sleek, kinetic-dampening armor over bodies honed by synthetic hemoglobin and reinforced myelin sheaths.

"The Human Trigger," the leader's voice boomed, amplified. "There's a high price on your head."

"Jax, load the ship," Zero commanded. "I'll buy you time."

"They're Corporate Aces," Jax warned, not stopping his work. "Gen-Mods. Be careful."

Zero ignited the Lobotomizer. "Let's see if your nervous system has a firewall."

He focused, pushing the logic packet at the leader, trying to crash his motor cortex. *Breathe. Sync. Crash.*

Nothing happened. The leader didn't stumble. His armor didn't freeze.

"Cyber-Pure," Zero realized, a cold knot forming in his stomach. "No neural jacks. No handshakes."

The Ace fired a plasma bolt. Zero deflected it with the flat of his blade, the magnetic field shoving the superheated gas aside, but the impact jarred his shoulder. He slashed at the leader’s leg, but the refined durasteel armor held, sparks showering the floor.

"Refined durasteel," the Ace laughed, backhanding Zero with a gauntleted fist.

Zero hit a crate, his ribs screaming in protest. He rolled, barely dodging a follow-up stomp that cracked the concrete floor.

"Zero!" Val yelled over the comms. "We're clear, but you're pinned!"

"Cas! Drop the Titan!" Zero screamed, spitting blood.

"You'll depressurize the station!" Cas argued.

"DO IT!"

The ceiling tore open with a deafening screech of rending metal. Emergency shutters slammed down as debris rained onto the deck, followed by forty tons of fusion-powered consequences. **Hades dropped.**

The impact shook the entire station. Zero scrambled up the gantry and vaulted into the open cockpit.

*// HELLO, ZERO. //*

"Time to go," Zero growled.

The Titan moved. Zero punched the Ace leader, sending him flying into the far wall with a wet crunch. "Get out of my way."

He grabbed the pallet of supplies Jax had prepped and fired the jump-jets, blasting out through the hole in the roof.

"You reckless idiot," Val snapped as they docked. "But good catch on the drop."

# Chapter 8: The NSFW Awakening

"I need to know what he is," Val said, her voice tight. The mess hall was quiet, save for the hum of the ship's reactor. "The telemetry from the last fight... that wasn't programming. Algorithms don't hesitate. They don't protect."

"It's a mech, Val," Zero said, nursing a bulb of synthetic whiskey. "It's hardware."

"My father worked on the Ghost Protocol," Val countered, staring at the holographic display of the Titan's core. "He told me about the theory. Mapping a human consciousness to a neural network. If that thing has a human consciousness, it's not a weapon. It's a prisoner."

Zero looked at Cas. The hacker was curled up in her chair, hugging a plushie, her face pale.

"You're right," Cas whispered, her usual manic energy gone. "I cracked the encryption. His name is Orion. He was seven years old when they... uploaded him."

Val sank into her chair, the color draining from her face. "We have to get him out."

"We can't," Cas said, shaking her head. "He *is* the core. His connectome is mapped to the fusion core's lattice. If we try to extract him, the data degrades. He dies."

"So we keep him," Zero said, his voice hard. "We don't sell him to Silas. We don't return him to Cognis. We become pirates."

"Piracy implies we have a choice," Jax rumbled from the corner, cleaning his bayonet. "We're already fugitives."

Suddenly, the ship's proximity alarm screamed. Red light washed over the mess hall.

"Contacts!" Val yelled, sprinting for the cockpit. "Multiple signatures. Corporate Blockade class."

Zero followed her, sliding into the co-pilot seat. The viewscreen showed a wall of steel—three Cognis cruisers and a swarm of interceptors blocking their vector.

A hail opened. Silas's face appeared on the HUD, calm, collected, and terrifyingly polite.

"Zero," Silas said. "You're off course. Bring the prototype to the designated coordinates. I have a team ready to strip it down for analysis."

"Analysis?" Zero spat. "You mean dissection."

"It's a machine, Zero," Silas said, adjusting his cuff. "Don't anthropomorphize the inventory. Surrender the Asset, and I'll wipe your debt. I'll even upgrade you all to **Gold Status**. Priority access. No more running."

"No," Zero said. "The Asset has a name. And he's not for sale."

Silas sighed, looking disappointed. "Then I'm afraid the audit is over. All units... liquidate the debt."

The cruisers' weapon ports glowed blue.

"Val," Zero said, looking at the pilot. "Can you fly through that?"

Val’s hands danced over the controls, her eyes locked on the wall of death ahead. A grim smile touched her lips.

"I can fly through hell," she said. "Hold on."

# Chapter 9: The Gauntlet

"Launching!" Zero yelled.

The cargo bay doors blasted open, and the Titan shot out into the void, its thrusters screaming. Zero synced instantly, the white noise of the connection flooding his mind.

*// ORION READY. //*

"Let's clear a path," Zero said.

The interceptors swarmed like angry hornets. Zero didn't try to outmaneuver them; he went through them. He pushed the Titan's thrusters to 150%, the g-force threatening to crush him against the pilot's couch.

He ignited the fusion blade. In the vacuum of space, the plasma edge was a silent, blinding line of violet destruction. He swung the massive sword, cleaving an interceptor in two as he roared past. The explosion was a brief, expanding sphere of gas that vanished as quickly as it appeared.

"Concentrate fire on the prototype!" Silas's voice cut through the open comms channel.

The lead cruiser fired its turbo-lasers. Beams of coherent light slashed through the dark.

"I can't shake them!" Val yelled over the comms. "Shields are at 30%!"

"I need a hole!" Zero gritted out, deflecting a laser blast with the Titan's energy shield.

"I can't make one!"

"Then I will."

Zero cut the thrusters and flipped the Titan 180 degrees. He locked onto the command cruiser—Silas's ship.

"Hades... I mean, Orion. Divert all power to the jump-jets."

*// WARNING. SAFETY LIMITS EXCEEDED. //*

"Do it!"

Zero engaged the jets. The Titan became a meteor, streaking toward the cruiser. Point-defense cannons filled the space around him with flak, but he weaved through the fire, the Scrapper's Flow guiding his hands.

He didn't fire at the ship. He landed on it.

The Titan's magnetic clamps locked onto the cruiser's bridge viewports with a bone-jarring thud. Zero looked through the reinforced glass. He saw Silas, standing on the bridge, his eyes wide with genuine shock.

Zero raised the fusion blade. He channeled the reactor's output into the edge, turning the tungsten white-hot.

"Transaction denied," Zero whispered.

He drove the blade down. It didn't pierce the hull—it overloaded the shield generator directly beneath the bridge. A massive feedback loop surged through the cruiser's systems. Lights blew out. Engines stalled. The ship drifted, dead in the water.

"NOW!" Zero screamed.

The *Rusty Nail* shot past the disabled cruiser, its engines flaring blue as Val punched the fusion torch.

Zero disengaged the mag-clamps and pushed off the hull, firing his maneuvering thrusters to match the ship's vector.

"Gotcha!" Jax yelled. The cargo bay's tractor beam locked onto the Titan, reeling it in like a massive fish.

"Jump!" Val commanded.

The stars elongated into streaks of light. The blockade vanished. They were gone.

# Chapter 10: The Void

The *Rusty Nail* cut its engines in deep space, millions of kilometers from the nearest Cognis relay. The silence of the void was heavy, peaceful, broken only by the cooling ticks of the reactor.

Zero climbed out of the Titan's cockpit, his flight suit soaked in sweat, his nose bleeding from the neural strain. He stumbled onto the gantry, his mag-boots clicking against the deck.

Val was there. She didn't say anything. She just shoved a bottle of water into his hand. "You're insane," she said, her voice shaking slightly. "But that was... good flying."

"Professional flying," Zero corrected, taking a long drink.

Jax slapped him on the back, the massive gauntlet of his Dread-Plate nearly knocking the wind out of him. The impact would have sent Zero spinning in the zero-g, but his magnetic soles held him firm. "Did you see his face? Silas looked like he swallowed a lemon!" The giant laughed, a deep, tectonic rumble that filled the bay.

Cas spun around in her chair, her face lit by the glow of her screens. "You guys aren't going to believe this. The footage from the fight? It's viral. We're trending #1 on the Shadow-Net. 'Kill-Creds' are through the roof."

"Great," Zero said, wiping the blood from his lip. "We're famous. And hunted."

"Now what?" Val asked, leaning against the railing.

Zero looked at the Titan—at Orion. The machine hummed softly, the blue light of the core pulsing like a heartbeat.

"We find Pirate Haven," Zero said. "We get supplies. We fix Orion."

"And then?" Jax asked.

"And then we burn them down," Zero said. "Cognis. The Mandate. All of it."

A message pinged on Zero's comms. It was from Silas.

*Tuition is due, Mr. Vex. I'll see you in the black.*

Zero deleted it without hesitation. He looked out the viewport at the endless sea of stars. They were outlaws now. Ghosts. But for the first time in a long time, he wasn't alone.

"We are the Human Trigger," Zero whispered, the words feeling like a promise. "And the safety is off."
