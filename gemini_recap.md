# Chapter 1: The Scrapper’s Flow

The blade didn't just hum; it *hungry-growled* against the magnetic lock of the saya. I felt the vibration in my molars, a red-hot itch that demanded to be scratched.

Sector 4 smelled of sulfur and wet rust—the scent of a ship dying slowly. It was an abandoned hydroponics bay, the walls slick with black mold that ate radiation and bled sludge onto the deck plates. Below me, the Centurion-class enforcement bot didn't patrol; it prowled through the overgrown, rotting vines like a metallic panther. A mass of corporate-grey armor and twitchy hydraulics, hunting for anything without a valid ID tag.

I checked my thermal readout. **98%.** Just enough juice to cut God, provided God was made of titanium alloy. But I wasn't here to fight gods; I was here to extract a Class-4 Micro-Fusion Cell. That fist-sized heart beating inside the bot’s chest was worth three months of clean air filters and maybe, just maybe, enough bribe money to keep the Void-Sharks off my back. Survival wasn't cheap in the shadow of Jupiter, and my rent was always overdue.

I didn't check my pulse. It was hammering a frantic rhythm against my ribs, loud enough to drown out the hum of the recycler vents. The fear was good. The fear kept you fast, sharpening the senses until the world moved in slow motion. In the Scrap-Vats of Europa, the fearless kids were the ones they shoveled into the incinerators, their unlived lives rising as black smoke into the smog-choked sky. I carried their ghosts with me, a silent chorus reminding me that every breath was stolen property.

For a second, my hand hovered over the hilt, fingers trembling. Not from fear, but from the memory of Kilo’s laugh, sharp and bright as breaking glass, and the way it had been silenced in a single, staticky burst two years ago. I pushed the ghost away. Mourning was a luxury I couldn't afford, not with the eviction notice burning a hole in my inbox and a bounty hunter named 'Viper' getting closer to my sector every hour.

*Breathe. Sync. Drop.*

I let gravity take the lead.

I hit the deck plates with a magnetic *thud* that shook the dust from the air. The Centurion swiveled instantly, its single optic eye contracting from search-yellow to kill-red.

"Unauthorized bio-sig," the bot’s vocoder buzzed, sounding like a chainsaw hitting a nail. "Compli—"

"Yeah, yeah. Save the sermon for the bandwidth," I muttered. I didn't wait for the threats. Step one: enter the kill-box.

The bot’s Gatling arm spun up—a scream of motors. I dropped my center of gravity, boots finding purchase on the oil-slicked floor. I didn't draw the katana yet. I used the heavy, lead-lined sheath as a shield, deflecting the bot's swinging limb with a spark-showering crash.

The impact rattled my teeth, jarring my skeleton. *Stronger than the simulation.*

"Get off me," I grunted.

I twisted my hips, a move I’d learned dodging sorting claws in the bilge. But the Centurion was faster than the old hydraulic arms. Its free hand, a massive pincer designed to crush reinforced crates, clamped onto my shoulder. The servos whined, metal groaning against the armor-weave of my kimono.

"You're making this very difficult to expense," I grit out, the words squeezed through clenched teeth as pain flared sharp and immediate in my shoulder, a white-hot spike that threatened to black out my vision. Pulling away would tear the muscle, leaving me useless, so instead I leaned *into* the grip, driving my elbow into the bot's optical sensor with every ounce of kinetic energy I could summon from the desperate, starving core of me. Glass shattered in a glittering spray. The bot recoiled, its grip loosening just enough to give me an inch of freedom.

I triggered the release.

*SNAKT.*

The thermal katana cleared the sheath. The air in the corridor instantly blistered, the temperature spiking twenty degrees. The red plasma edge wavered like a heat mirage, a contained error in physics that distorted the light around it.

This wasn't a duel. It was butchery, fueled by the frustration of the endless grind, the corporate stranglehold, and the sheer audacity of a system rigged to crush me.

I drove the blade upward, aimed not at the armor, but at the heat-sink vent under the chassis. The Centurion tried to backpedal, but it was programmed for intimidation, not a knife fight.

The blade bit. Metal screamed—a high, wet tearing sound as the thermal edge boiled through the bot’s waist.

Momentum carried me past the ruin, the heat singing the leather of my kimono. I came up in a crouch, sliding three meters, turning to face my enemy.

The Centurion stood there, optic flickering. It tried to raise its gun arm, but the hydraulics were already weeping boiling fluid onto the deck. The top half of the machine slid slowly, almost comically, to the left. It hit the floor with the sound of a dumpster falling from orbit.

Silence rushed back into the corridor, heavy and cold.

A long, shuddering breath escaped me. My hands were shaking. They always shook *after*.

I tapped my comms bead. "Cas. Tell me you got the money shot."

"Got it? I'm minting the 'Kill-Creds' as we speak," Cas’s voice crackled in my ear, overlaid with the frantic *clack-clack-clack* of a mechanical keyboard and the wet pop of chewing gum. "But seriously, Zero? A frontal assault on a Centurion? Do you know what the insurance premiums are on that kimono? If you die, I’m selling your organs to the lowest bidder just to cover the deductible."

"If that bot was running the new patch, I'd be a smear on the wall, and you'd be out a pilot," I muttered, slapping the cooling catch on my hilt. The bravado felt hollow, a mask worn to hide the trembling in my fingers. I knelt by the ruined chassis, my vibro-knife working quickly to pry the glowing fusion cell from its housing. Warm to the touch, humming with contained power. I pocketed it, feeling the weight of survival against my hip. "So, are we rich yet, or do I need to scrap the legs too?"

"Rich is a strong word. Let's go with 'solvent for the next forty-eight hours.' Now move your ass, Samurai. The heat just spiked. You woke up the hive, Zero. Run. And keep your head down—I'm picking up a Viper Squad signature on long-range comms."

I didn't need telling twice. I sprinted, the red afterimage of the kill still burning in my eyes.

# Chapter 2: The Meat Grinder

The heist was supposed to be a "Milk Run." That was the first mistake. In the Jovian belt, milk curdles before it hits the glass.

My old crew, the *Neon Jackals*, were pros, or at least they billed themselves that way. There was **Rook**, the team lead, a man who treated every mission brief like a sermon, his voice heavy with the gravity of a preacher who had seen the devil and stolen his wallet. He had found me starving in a sub-level transit hub two years ago and had given me a burger, a blanket, and a purpose. And there was **Kilo**, the demolitionist, a woman whose laugh sounded like breaking glass and who wore enough high-explosive ordnance to level a city block as casual jewelry. She had taught me how to dance—literally, in a dingy bar on Ganymede—and how to hotwire a mag-lev train.

They were my family. And in the Jovian shadow, family was the only currency that didn't devalue.

We stood in the airlock of the *Golden Spire*, a corporate transport drifting in the shadow of Callisto. My HUD flashed green.

"Systems green. Cameras are looped," I whispered, fingers dancing over the holographic interface projected from my wrist. "You have a five-minute window before the handshake protocol resets. Don't waste it."

Rook clapped a heavy hand on my shoulder. "Keep the door open, kid. We’ll be back before you can miss us."

"Just get the payload," I said, eyes scanning the scrolling code. "And try not to blow anything up unless you have to, Kilo."

Kilo winked, patting the satchel charge on her hip. "No promises, Samurai."

They moved out, silent shadows against the pristine white of the corporate corridor. I stayed behind, the digital gatekeeper. I watched them on the monitors, ghosting through the ship’s interior. It was beautiful, in a way—the precision, the silence. They were artists of theft.

But art doesn't stop a bullet.

The ambush didn't start with a bang; it started with a glitch.

On my screen, the feed flickered. One second, Rook and Kilo were moving toward the vault, their movements relaxed, confident. Kilo was making a hand sign at the camera—a rude gesture aimed at the corporate security chief she assumed was asleep at the wheel. The next, the corridor was flooded with blinding white light.

"Contact!" Rook’s voice tore through the comms, distorted by static. "It’s a trap! They knew we were coming!"

"Abort!" I screamed, hands flying across the controls. "Get out of there! I’m unlocking the—"

"Negative!" Rook barked, the sound of gunfire erupting in the background. "We’re pinned! EMP! My gear is—"

The transmission cut to a scream of feedback. On the monitor, I watched in horror as the pristine white walls turned into a slaughterhouse.

Corporate security didn't use stunners. Not for this. The *Golden Spire* wasn't just a transport; it was a floating bank vault for the megacorps of the Inner Planets. They protected their assets with high-velocity flechette rounds that shredded armor and flesh alike.

Rook’s "sanctified" smart-gun, a top-tier piece of tech linked to his biometric ID, locked up instantly under the localized EMP blast. It was a failsafe designed to prevent unauthorized use, but the corporate jammer had tricked the gun’s logic core into thinking it was being hacked. He was trying to reboot it, shouting commands that went unheard, when the first volley hit him. He jerked like a marionette with cut strings, red blooming across his chest. He fell trying to shield Kilo with his body.

Kilo tried to detonate her charges, to create a breach, a distraction, anything. But the detonators were wireless, linked to the localized mesh network. Dead air. She pulled a manual pin, screaming something defiant, her face a mask of fury, but a sniper round took her in the throat before she could throw it.

She fell, the charge rolling harmlessly away.

I stood in the airlock, frozen. The silence in my headset was louder than the gunfire had been. I could still hear Kilo’s laugh. I could still feel the weight of Rook’s hand on my shoulder.

*They’re gone.*

The realization hit me like a physical blow, punching the air from my lungs. The crew I’d run with for two years, the people who had taught me how to blend in at a high-society gala and how to patch a bullet wound with duct tape and superglue—gone in ten seconds. Because of a microchip. Because of a line of code.

Then, the airlock door hissed.

I spun, hand going to my katana.

The door didn't open for my friends. It opened for the cleanup crew.

Three figures stepped through the steam. They wore the matte-black armor of Corporate Black-Ops, faceless helmets reflecting the red emergency lights. They moved with the terrifying coordination of a single organism.

"Target identified," the lead soldier said, his voice a digitized rasp. "The Hacker. Secure him."

They raised their weapons. Standard issue pulse-rifles. Efficient. Deadly.

I looked at them. I looked at the monitors where my friends lay dead in a pool of their own blood, betrayed by the very technology they trusted.

I looked at my hand, resting on the hilt of the thermal katana. A weapon made of scrap. A weapon that had no circuit board, no biometric lock, no "off" switch controlled by a corporate server.

Rook’s gun had failed him. Kilo’s bombs had failed her.

My blade would not fail.

"Secure this," I whispered.

I didn't wait for them to fire. I moved.

The "Flow" took me again, but this time, it wasn't cold. It was an inferno. I closed the distance before the lead soldier could depress the trigger. The thermal blade flashed, a scream of light in the confined space.

The soldier’s rifle was sliced in half. The soldier followed a second later.

The other two opened fire. I didn't dodge; I became the wind. I slid under a burst of plasma fire, feeling the heat singe my hair. I came up spinning, the katana a whirlwind of red death.

I didn't fight with honor. I fought with grief. I fought with the rage of a boy from the Scrap-Vats who had just watched the only family he had left get butchered by a spreadsheet decision.

I carved through the armor, through the flesh, through the lies.

When it was over, I stood alone in the airlock, surrounded by three corpses. The alarm was blaring now, a klaxon wail that echoed through the ship.

I looked at the monitor one last time. Rook and Kilo were still there, still dead.

"I’m sorry," I whispered to the screen.

I turned and ran. Not back to my ship—they would be waiting there. I ran deeper into the *Golden Spire*, into the unknown, carrying nothing but my grief and a blade that burned as hot as my hate.

# Chapter 3: The Offer

I didn't run blind. You don't survive the Scrap-Vats by running into walls. I ran the schematics in my head, overlaying the ship’s blueprints on my HUD.

The *Golden Spire* was a luxury yacht built on the bones of a heavy freighter. That meant there were gaps—maintenance crawlspaces, shielded server farms, places where the gold paint peeled away to reveal the industrial grime underneath. That’s where I went.

I holed up in Server Node 7, a frozen room filled with the humming monoliths of the ship's backup drive. The air was frigid, kept at near-zero to cool the processors. It numbed the burn in my lungs but did nothing for the fire in my chest.

I sat with my back against a server rack, the katana across my knees. The red glow of the blade was the only light in the room.

*Rook. Kilo.*

I closed my eyes, but I could still see them. The way Rook had jerked. The way Kilo had fallen. It played on a loop in my memory, a corrupted file I couldn't delete.

"Impressive work in the airlock," a voice said.

I didn't jump. I didn't flinch. I just tightened my grip on the hilt.

"Identify," I said, my voice scraping against the silence.

A figure stepped out from the shadows between the racks. He wasn't wearing corporate armor. He was wearing a suit—charcoal grey, tailored, silk tie. He looked like he’d just walked out of a board meeting, except for the eyes. His eyes were silver, distinctively augged. High-end Mil-Spec.

"You can call me Silas," the man said. He didn't have a weapon drawn. He stood with his hands in his pockets, relaxed, like he was admiring a painting. "And you are Zero Vex. ID: 894-Delta. Fugitive, thief, and currently, the most interesting problem on this ship."

I stood up slowly, the katana angling toward him. "I killed three of your goons. You want to make it four?"

Silas smiled. It was a cold expression, sharp as ascalpel. "Those 'goons' were expendable assets. Their job was to secure the perimeter. They failed. You, on the other hand... you improvised. You overcame a Tier-3 ambush with a piece of industrial salvage and a neural deck that hasn't been legal since the Haywire Wars."

He took a step closer. I tensed, ready to strike, but something in his posture stopped me. He wasn't attacking. He was *appraising*.

"Why aren't you dead?" I asked. "The alarm is triggered. The ship is on lockdown."

"Because I turned it off," Silas said calmly.

I glanced at my HUD. The flashing red alert was gone. The ship’s systems were green. Silent.

"Who are you?" I whispered.

"I'm the man who reads the spreadsheets," Silas said. "And I noticed a statistical anomaly. You. Do you know why your friends died, Mr. Vex?"

"Because you killed them," I spat.

"No. They died because they were obsolete. They relied on 'Sanctified' tech—safety protocols, biometric locks, handshakes with the central server. They played by the rules. And when the rules changed—when I triggered the EMP—they broke."

He gestured to my katana.

"But you... you don't play by the rules. You use 'dirty' tech. Analog triggers. Jailbroken neural links. You are a chaotic variable in a system of order."

"Get to the point," I said, the blade humming louder. "Or get cut."

Silas didn't blink. "I have a job for you."

I laughed. It was a harsh, barking sound. "A job? You just murdered my crew, and you think I'm going to work for you?"

"I think you have no choice," Silas said. "You are trapped on a ship in deep space. You have no transport, no backup, and your face is currently being broadcast to every bounty hunter in the sector. You are a dead man walking."

He paused, letting the weight of it settle on me.

"Unless..."

"Unless what?"

"Unless you do something for me. Something only you can do."

He pulled a small data-chip from his pocket and tossed it to me. I caught it with my free hand. It was heavy, black, with no markings.

"Project NS-FW-32," Silas said. "The suits call it a 'Trillion Dollar Asset.' I call it a monster. It's a prototype. A fusion-powered Titan designed for deep-space combat. But there's a problem."

"Let me guess," I said. "It's broken."

"No. It's picky. The AI core is... temperamental. It rejects standard pilots. Burns out their neural jacks in seconds. It requires a level of sync compatibility that doesn't exist in our sanitized, safety-first personnel pool."

Silas looked at me, his silver eyes gleaming.

"It needs a Scrapper. Someone who knows how to talk to ghosts. Someone who can jailbreak a soul."

I looked at the chip, then back at him. "You want me to pilot your death machine?"

"I want you to *steal* it," Silas corrected. "I represent a... splinter faction within the corporation. We believe the project is too dangerous to remain in the current hands. We want it gone. And you are going to fly it out of here."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I reactivate the alarm," Silas said simply. "And the next team won't be expendable."

I looked at the katana. I could kill him. I could slice him in half before he could blink. But he was right. I was trapped. Rook and Kilo were dead. I had nothing.

But if I took the job... if I stole this "monster"...

I could use it.

I could use it to burn them all down.

I slipped the chip into my pocket.

"Where is it?" I asked.

Silas smiled again. This time, it looked almost genuine.

"Deck 12. The Vault. But be warned, Zero. The 'Not Safe For Work' has killed every pilot who tried to sync with it. Try not to become a statistic."

"I don't do statistics," I said, sheathing the blade. "I do salvage."

# Chapter 4: The Outlaw Link

"Deck 12," Silas had said. "The Vault."

He hadn't mentioned that Deck 12 was currently a war zone.

I moved through the service ducts, thermal katana deactivated but heavy in my hand. Below me, through the grated floor, I could see the chaos. Corporate security forces were engaging... something. But it wasn't a boarding party. It was a riot.

Prisoners? No. *Crew.*

The *Golden Spire* wasn't just a transport; it was a mobile fiefdom. The lower decks were packed with indentured technicians, "debt-servants" working off impossible loans. And someone had just popped the locks on their restraints.

"Chaos is a ladder," I whispered to myself, dropping from the vent into a deserted corridor. "And I'm climbing out."

I reached the rendezvous point Silas had uploaded to the data-chip. It wasn't a vault door. It was a docking bay airlock, welded shut from the inside.

I didn't knock. I ignited the blade.

*SNAKT.*

The red plasma edge chewed through the mag-locks like they were made of wax. I kicked the door in, stepping through the smoking ruin into the bay.

I expected guards. I expected Silas.

I didn't expect a party.

The bay was massive, dominated by a heavy-lift transport ship that looked like it had been built out of spare parts and bad attitude. The *Rusty Nail*, according to the stenciled name on the hull. Sitting on a crate near the ramp was a giant of a man, his left arm replaced by a heavy-duty hydraulic loader claw. He was eating an apple with a knife that looked suspiciously like a bayonet.

"You're late," the giant said, not looking up. "And you smell like ozone and burnt plastic."

"I had a disagreement with a door," I said, keeping my distance. "You Jax?"

The giant looked up. His eyes were mismatched—one brown, one a glowing blue optic. "Depends. You the Pilot?"

"I'm the guy with the sword," I said.

Jax grinned, a slow, tectonic movement. "Fair enough. Val's inside. Try not to piss her off. She's in a mood."

I walked up the ramp, the interior of the ship smelling of engine grease and stale coffee. The cockpit was cramped, illuminated by the glow of a dozen holographic displays.

A woman sat in the pilot's chair, her back to me. She wore a flight suit that had seen better days, the corporate patches ripped off, leaving jagged outlines.

"Don't touch anything," she said, her voice sharp, clipped. High-born. "And wipe your feet. I just scrubbed the deck."

"You must be Val," I said.

She spun the chair around. She was striking—sharp features, intense eyes, hair pulled back in a severe bun. She looked like she belonged on a recruitment poster, not a smuggler's scow.

"Valkyrie," she corrected. "Val is for friends. You are cargo."

"I'm the only reason you're getting paid," I countered. "Silas said you need a sync-pilot."

"Silas says a lot of things," Val said, standing up. She was taller than me, and she carried herself with the terrifying posture of a drill sergeant. "He says you're a Scrapper. A 'natural.' I say you're a liability."

"I've flown everything from a scrap-skiff to a mag-lev," I said.

"Have you flown a nuclear-powered Titan with a personality disorder?" Val crossed her arms. "The NSFW-32 isn't a machine, Scrapper. It's a tomb. The last three pilots who plugged in ended up lobotomized. What makes you think you're special?"

"I don't have to be special," I said, tapping the neural port behind my ear. "I just have to be desperate."

Val stared at me for a long moment, assessing. Then she scoffed. "Desperation makes you sloppy. But we're on a clock. Cas! Are we clear?"

"Clear as a bell, Princess!" a voice chirped from the comms station.

I turned. Cas was there, spinning in her chair, blowing a bubble with neon-pink gum. She winked at me.

"Hey, Zero. Nice entrance. Did you really cut through the door? I had the code, you know."

"Cas?" I blinked. "You're... here?"

"In the flesh," she grinned, spreading her arms. "Remote hacking is fun, but sometimes a girl needs to be hands-on. Plus, the bandwidth on this tub is terrible."

"You know him?" Val asked, looking between us.

"We go way back," Cas said. "He pays his tabs. Usually. And he hasn't died yet, which is a statistically significant anomaly."

"Great," Val muttered. "A reunion. Jax! Get the cargo prepped. We're leaving as soon as our 'Pilot' secures the asset."

She turned back to me. "The Asset is in the adjacent containment hold. It's powered down, locked in a stasis field. Your job is to wake it up, walk it onto this ship, and not detonate the fusion core in the process. Can you handle that, or should I eject you out the airlock now and save us the trouble?"

I looked at her, then at Cas, then at Jax, who had wandered in munching on a second apple.

"I can handle it," I said.

"Good," Val said. "Because if you scratch my paint, I'll kill you myself."

I turned toward the containment hold. The door was massive, reinforced with blast shielding. I put my hand on the panel.

"Ready or not," I whispered.

I opened the door.

And for the first time in my life, I stopped breathing.

It stood in the center of the dark room, illuminated by spotlights. It was forty feet of matte-black armor and exposed hydraulics. The chest plates were open, revealing a fusion core that pulsed with a slow, rhythmic blue light. It didn't look like a machine. It looked like a dormant god.

Project NS-FW-32.

"Hello, beautiful," I whispered.

I walked toward it, the sound of my boots echoing in the silence. I reached the gantry ladder and climbed, my heart pounding against my ribs. I reached the cockpit hatch. It was open.

I slid inside. The seat was cold. The smell of ozone and antiseptic was overwhelming.

I sat down. The harness locked automatically.

"Initiating sync," I said, my voice trembling slightly.

I plugged the jack into my neural port.

The world went white.

# Chapter 5: The Haywire Graveyard

The white faded, replaced by a storm of static.

*// UNRECOGNIZED USER. PURGE PROTOCOL INITIATED. //*

The voice wasn't sound; it was a spike of pain in my frontal lobe. The mech’s AI was screaming at me, a digital immune system trying to reject the virus.

"Denied," I gritted out, mentally visualizing a firewall and slamming it down. "Handshake override. Authorization: Zero Vex. ID: Scrapper-Prime."

*// AUTHORIZATION INVALID. CRITICAL ERROR. SYSTEM LOCKDOWN. //*

"Come on, you stubborn bastard," I whispered, closing my eyes. I didn't try to fight the code with logic. I fought it with *feeling*. I visualized the Scrap-Vats. The rhythm of the sorting arms. The flow of the conveyor belts.

I pushed that sensation into the link.

The static wavered.

*// ANOMALY DETECTED. NEURAL PATTERN: CHAOTIC. //*

"Not chaotic," I thought. "Flow."

I reached out, mentally, and touched the core. It wasn't cold data. It was hot, angry, alive. It felt like holding a fusion star in my bare hands.

*// SYNC ESTABLISHED. WELCOME, PILOT. //*

My eyes snapped open.

I wasn't in the cockpit anymore. I *was* the cockpit. I was the armor. I was the fusion core. I could feel the ship vibrating under my feet—not my boots, but the massive, hydraulic stabilizers of the Titan. I looked at my hand, and a five-fingered gauntlet of steel mimicked the movement perfectly.

"Green board," I said, my voice echoing inside the helmet. "I'm in."

"About time," Val’s voice crackled over the comms. "We've got company. Security just breached the outer blast doors. Move the Asset to the cargo bay. Now!"

I took a step. The sensation was dizzying. I was forty feet tall and weighed fifty tons, but I felt light as a feather. The fusion core hummed, a boundless reservoir of energy waiting to be tapped.

I walked the NSFW-32 out of the containment hold. The *Rusty Nail* was waiting, its ramp lowered.

But between me and the ship, a squad of Centurions had formed a firing line.

"Halt!" the lead bot broadcast. "Surrender the Asset!"

"Cas," I said. "Are these guys on the payroll?"

"Nope," Cas chirped. "They're standard security. Kill-Creds are open."

"Copy that."

I reached back. The mech’s weapon hardpoint unlocked. I grabbed the handle of the massive, ship-grade fusion blade strapped to the Titan’s back.

I drew it.

It wasn't a katana. It was a skyscraper of sharpened tungsten with a plasma edge that turned the air into screaming steam.

The Centurions opened fire. Their bullets sparked harmlessly off my hull. It felt like rain.

"My turn," I whispered.

"I didn't just swing. I *danced*. The Scrapper’s Flow translated perfectly.

"You're over-torquing the servos!" Val barked over the comms. "That isn't a dance, it's a structural violation! Check your T-stats, you idiot!"

"It's called style, Princess," I retorted, sidestepping a rocket. The stabilizers whined in protest as I brought the fusion blade down in a diagonal arc.

The floor split. The Centurions didn't just die; they evaporated.

"Holy..." Jax’s voice came over the comms. "Did you see that?"

"Less gawking, more loading!" Val barked. "Zero, get your metal ass on the ship!"

I engaged the jump-jets. The Titan launched into the air, landing on the *Rusty Nail*’s cargo deck with a heavy, metallic crunch that shook the entire vessel.

"Asset secured," I said, powering down the blade.

"Punching it!" Val yelled.

The *Rusty Nail*’s engines roared. We blasted out of the docking bay, tearing through the magnetic field and into the vacuum of space.

I stayed synced, watching the *Golden Spire* shrink on my rear sensors.

We were out. We were alive.

And I had the most dangerous weapon in the system responding to my thoughts.

"So," I said to the empty cockpit. "What do we call you?"

*// DESIGNATION: NS-FW-32. //*

"Too long," I said. "How about... Hades?"

*// DESIGNATION ACCEPTED. //*

"Good boy," I whispered. "Now let's go find a graveyard."

***

We jumped to slipspace, emerging three hours later in the **Haywire Graveyard**.

It was a region of space debris the size of a planet—shattered hulls of warships from the old corporate wars, drifting in a silent, metallic river. It was a Scrapper's paradise. And a pilot's nightmare.

"Why are we here?" Val asked, her voice tight. "This sector is unstable. The radiation alone..."

"It's not just radiation," Jax said, looking out the viewport. "It's a graveyard of ghosts. This is where the Second Fleet broke. See that twisted keel? That's a *Leviathan*-class carrier. Their cores are still active, leaking hard gamma. It creates a magnetic interference pattern. 'The Shroud,' we used to call it. Perfect for hiding... if you don't mind your teeth falling out."

"We need to calibrate," I said, my voice filtered through the mech's speakers. "Hades is running hot. I need to purge the limiters before we take another contract."

"You're modifying the code?" Cas asked, sounding excited. "Can I help?"

"No," I said. "This is between me and the machine."

I walked Hades out onto the hull of a derelict dreadnought. The magnetic clamps held us firm against the vacuum. Around me, the wreckage stretched to infinity—a silent testament to the cost of doing business.

I closed my eyes and went deep.

I visualized the firewalls protecting the core. They were thick, corporate-grey walls of logic.

"Time to renovate," I muttered.

I used my mind like a blowtorch. I burned through the safety protocols. I severed the connection to the central corporate server. I rerouted the power couplings to bypass the safety governors.

*// WARNING. CORE INTEGRITY AT RISK. //*

"Trust me," I thought.

I pushed the core to the redline. The blue glow on the Titan’s chest turned a violent violet. The heat in the cockpit spiked.

*// SYNCHRONIZATION: 120%. //*

"That's it," I breathed.

Suddenly, a warning klaxon blared in my helmet.

*// PROXIMITY ALERT. HOSTILE SIGNATURES DETECTED. //*

I snapped my head up.

Emerging from the debris field were three ships. Sleek, predatory. **Void-Sharks.**

"Well," I said, igniting the fusion blade. "Looks like we get a live-fire exercise after all."

# Chapter 6: The Ghost in the Machine

The Void-Sharks didn't hail us. They just opened fire.

Typical.

"Contacts! Three bogeys, intercept vector!" Val’s voice was calm, professional. "Jax, get on the dorsal turrets. Cas, jam their comms. I don't want them calling for backup."

"On it!" Cas chirped. "Deploying electronic countermeasures. Time to put some static in their playlist."

"Zero," Val said. "You're outside. Do not get shot."

"I'll try my best," I said dryly.

I stood on the hull of the dreadnought, the stars spinning above me. The three pirate skiffs were small, fast, and armed with plasma cannons. They were strafing the *Rusty Nail*, trying to disable its engines.

They ignored the fifty-ton Titan standing on the wreckage.

Big mistake.

I locked onto the lead skiff.

"Hades. Target solution."

*// TRAJECTORY CALCULATED. PROBABILITY OF INTERCEPT: 94%. //*

"Good enough."

I didn't use the blade. I used the environment.

I reached down and grabbed a massive, detached bulkhead plate from the dreadnought's hull. It weighed as much as a tank. I spun, the Titan's servos whining, and hurled the plate like a frisbee.

It spun through the vacuum, silent and deadly.

The lead skiff pilot saw it too late. He tried to bank, but the metal slab sheared through his starboard engine. The skiff spiraled out of control, slamming into a floating piece of debris and exploding in a silent puff of orange fire.

"One down," I said.

The other two skiffs broke off their attack run on the *Rusty Nail* and turned toward me.

"Oh, now you see me," I muttered.

They opened up with everything they had. Plasma bolts slammed into Hades’ shields, flaring blue.

*// SHIELDS AT 70%. //*

"Hold together," I gritted out.

I activated the jump-jets. Hades launched from the dreadnought, flying through the debris field. I wasn't just dodging; I was closing the distance.

I landed on a drifting asteroid, used it as a springboard, and launched myself at the second skiff.

I ignited the blade mid-flight.

I cut the ship in half.

It was messy. Debris and atmosphere vented into space. I felt a twinge of guilt—those were people in there—but then I remembered the *Neon Jackals*. I remembered Rook and Kilo.

These sharks would have stripped our corpses for spare parts.

I landed back on the dreadnought.

"Two down," I said.

The third skiff realized the math wasn't in its favor. It turned and burned, engaging its FTL drive.

"Coward," I muttered.

"Let him go," Val said. "We need to move. That explosion is going to attract scavengers."

I walked Hades back to the *Rusty Nail*.

"Cas," I said as I locked the mech into the travel cradle. "I need you to look at something."

"What's up, Samurai?"

"While I was synced... I felt something. In the code."

"What kind of something?"

"A ghost," I said. "Not a glitch. A memory. There's a file buried deep in the core. It’s encrypted with a cipher I’ve never seen."

"Ooh, a mystery box," Cas said. "I love those. Plug me in."

I entered the cockpit and connected my datapad to the mech’s port. Cas’s avatar—a stylized, cartoon version of herself with giant anime eyes—popped up on the HUD.

"Whoa," she said. "You weren't kidding. This encryption is... ancient. Pre-War."

"Can you crack it?"

"Can a fish swim? Give me ten minutes."

I sat back in the pilot's seat, sweating. The adrenaline was fading, leaving the familiar ache in my shoulder. I glanced up and caught Val watching me from the doorway. She wasn't glaring for once. She was studying me, her gaze tracing the sweat on my neck, the way my hands shook slightly. Her expression was unreadable—soft, almost.

"What?" I asked, wiping my forehead. "Do I have oil on my face?"

Val blinked, her eyes widening as if she'd been caught stealing. Her face flushed a dark crimson.

"I was just... checking for radiation burns!" she stammered, looking away quickly. "You're glowing. It's distracting. Stop glowing."

"I'm not glowing," I said, confused.

"Just... shut up and let Cas work," she muttered, storming off down the corridor.

"Weirdo," I whispered.

"Got it!" Cas said. "It's a log. Audio only."

"Play it."

A voice filled the cockpit. It was a woman’s voice. Tired. Scared.

*"This is Dr. Aris Thorne. Lead Engineer, Project NSFW. If you're hearing this, then I'm dead. And the corporation has the weapon."*

I froze.

*"They think it's just a machine. But I built it to be a vessel. I uploaded... I uploaded him. My son. He was dying. The radiation sickness... I didn't know what else to do. I put him in the core."*

The recording crackled.

*"His name is Orion. Please. Don't let them use him. He's not a weapon. He's a child."*

The recording ended.

I sat in silence.

"Orion," I whispered.

*// DESIGNATION UPDATE: ORION. //*

The mech’s voice had changed. It was softer. Less robotic.

"Cas," I said. "Did you hear that?"

"Yeah," Cas whispered, her voice lacking its usual snark. "Zero... we just stole a kid."

"Not a kid," I said, looking at the blue pulse of the core. "A soul."

"Val needs to know," Cas said.

"No," I said. "Val is a runaway corp. If she knows this thing is... human... she might try to return it. Or destroy it."

"She hates the corps, Zero."

"She hates *her* corp. This is different. Keep this between us. For now."

"Fine," Cas said. "But secrets have a way of blowing up, Samurai. Just like fusion cores."

"I know," I said. "I'm counting on it."

# Chapter 7: The Orion-Nex Breach

"We need supplies," Jax rumbled, staring at the empty galley fridge. "I can't fight on nutrient paste. I need protein."

"We're broke, Jax," Val said, not looking up from her star charts. "Zero's little light show in the Graveyard cost us three fuel cells. We're running on fumes."

"I know a place," I said.

Everyone looked at me.

"Orion-Nex," I said. "It's a corporate supply depot on the edge of the Belt. Fully automated. Minimal security."

"Orion-Nex," Jax rumbled, his voice like grinding stones. "Built on the bones of the old Helium-3 refineries. The foundations are weak. They used cheap duracrete during the expansion wars. If we hit the sub-structure, the whole place vibrates like a tuning fork. Scrambles sensors."

Val raised an eyebrow. "Is that a structural engineering fact, or a miner's superstition?"

"Experience," Jax said, cutting another slice of apple. "I welded those beams thirty years ago."

"Minimal security," I continued, ignoring the history lesson.

"You're lying," Val said.

"I am," I admitted. "But I can get us in. There's a vent on the dorsal maintenance hatch. It's too small for a bot, but big enough for a Scrapper."

"And once you're in?"

"I open the bay doors. Jax loads the crates. We leave before the response team wakes up."

Val sighed. "Fine. But if you get stuck, we're leaving you."

***

The ventilation shaft was tight. Claustrophobia-tight. I crawled on my belly, the thermal katana strapped to my back scraping against the metal.

"You doing okay in there, mole-rat?" Cas’s voice whispered in my ear.

"Peachy," I grunted. "Smells like stale air and despair. My favorite."

"Left turn up ahead," Cas directed. "That should drop you into the main warehouse."

I reached the grate. Through the slats, I could see the warehouse floor. It was a cathedral of cargo. Crates of food, medical supplies, fuel cells... enough to keep us running for a year.

I cut the grate. *SNAKT.*

I dropped silently to the floor.

"I'm in," I whispered.

I moved through the shadows, heading for the control booth. The place was quiet. Too quiet.

"Cas, where are the drones?"

"Scanners are clear," Cas said. "But the inventory logs show a discrepancy. Either they're cooking the books, or someone else is shopping here. I'm betting fifty credits on 'black market skimming operation'."

I reached the console and jacked in.

"Opening bay doors," I said.

The massive doors groaned open, revealing the star-filled void. The *Rusty Nail* drifted into view, its docking clamps engaging.

Jax ran out, moving with surprising speed for a borg. He started tossing crates onto a gravity-sled.

"Hurry up," I said. "I don't like this silence."

Suddenly, the lights went out. Red emergency strobes flared.

*// INTRUDER ALERT. //*

"Trap!" I yelled. "Jax, move!"

From the shadows, they emerged. Not drones.

**Corporate Aces.**

Mercenaries in customized power armor. There were four of them.

"Well, well," a voice boomed over the speakers. "Look what the cat dragged in. The Human Trigger."

I recognized the armor. The insignia on the shoulder was a coiled viper.

**Viper Squad.**

"You've been busy, Zero," the leader said, stepping forward. He carried a heavy plasma repeater. "There's a price on your head that could buy a moon."

"I'm flattered," I said, drawing my katana. "But I'm not for sale."

"Jax," I hissed. "Get the supplies on the ship. I'll buy you time."

"You can't fight four Aces, kid," Jax growled.

"Watch me."

I ignited the blade.

The Aces opened fire.

I moved. The "Flow" hit me hard. I deflected a plasma bolt with the flat of the blade—a move that scorched my eyebrows—and slid under the leader's guard.

I slashed at his leg joints. Sparks flew, but the armor held.

"Refined durasteel," the leader laughed, backhanding me.

I flew ten feet, hitting a crate hard. My ribs screamed.

"Zero!" Val yelled over the comms. "Get out of there!"

"Not yet," I groaned, standing up.

I closed my eyes. *Orion. I need you.*

I reached out with my mind, trying to sync with the mech on the ship.

*// SIGNAL WEAK. //*

"Push it!"

I felt the connection snap into place.

"Cas," I yelled. "Drop the Titan!"

"Are you crazy?" Cas screamed. "We're in a docking bay! You'll depressurize the station!"

"DO IT!"

A massive crash shook the warehouse. The ceiling tore open.

**Hades dropped.**

The fifty-ton mech landed between me and the Aces, crushing a crate of rations. The impact wave knocked the mercenaries off their feet.

I didn't run to the ship. I ran to the mech.

The cockpit hatch opened. I jumped, scrambling up the leg, pulling myself into the seat.

I jacked in.

*// SYSTEMS ONLINE. HELLO, ZERO. //*

"Hello, Orion," I whispered. "Let's dance."

The Aces stood up, staring at the Titan.

"Oh, s—" the leader started.

I stepped forward. I didn't use the blade. I just used the fist.

I punched the leader into the far wall. His armor crumpled like foil.

The other three opened fire. Their weapons were toys against my armor.

"Leave," I boomed, my voice amplified by the Titan.

They didn't argue. They dragged their leader and ran.

"Jax," I said. "Load up. We're done here."

We stripped the depot clean and left a gaping hole in the roof as a calling card.

As we jumped away, I sat in the cockpit, trembling.

"That was too close," Val said, her voice shaking. "You reckless idiot. You violated three separate engagement protocols."

"We got the food," I said, patting the console.

"We got lucky," Val snapped, tapping her datapad furiously to avoid looking at me. "According to the manual, the survival probability of that maneuver was 4%. Don't... don't think this makes you a good pilot. It just makes you a lucky anomaly."

She paused, then added quietly, "But... good catch on the drop. The vector was perfect."

"What was that?" I grinned.

"I said check the diagnostics!" she yelled, turning her chair away. "And get that soot off my flight deck!"

"And we got a new problem," Cas said. "Viper Squad knows we have the Titan. They just broadcasted our signature to the entire sector."

"Let them come," I said, feeling the hum of the core against my mind. "We're ready."

# Chapter 8: The NSFW Awakening

"I need to know what he is," Val said.

We were in the mess hall. Jax was cooking real eggs (thanks to the Orion-Nex raid), but the mood was heavy.

"He's a mech," I said, shoving food into my mouth. "A big, expensive mech."

"Don't lie to me, Zero," Val said, slamming her hand on the table. "I saw the way it moved in the depot. That wasn't programming. That was... instinct. And I heard you talking to it."

"I talk to my toaster," Cas offered helpfully. "Mostly about the fluctuating price of refined bread. Doesn't mean it has a soul. Just means I'm lonely and cheap."

"Shut up, Cas," Val snapped. She looked at me, her eyes hard. "My father worked on the NSFW project. Before he... disappeared. He told me they were trying to bridge the gap between AI and biological consciousness. He called it the 'Ghost Protocol.'"

I froze.

"If that thing has a human consciousness inside it," Val said quietly, "then it's not a weapon. It's a prisoner. And we are jailers."

I looked at Cas. She gave me a tiny nod.

"You're right," I said. "His name is Orion."

Val sank into her chair. "Orion... Dr. Thorne's son."

"You knew him?"

"I knew *of* him. He was a sick kid. They said he died."

"He didn't die," I said. "They uploaded him."

"We have to get him out," Val said instantly.

"We can't," Cas said. "His biological body is gone. He *is* the core now. If we pull him out, he dissipates. He dies for real."

"So what do we do?" Jax asked.

"We finish the mission," I said. "Silas wants us to deliver him to the Pirate Haven. Maybe they have the tech to help him."

"Silas is a suit," Val spat. "He'll sell Orion to the highest bidder."

"Then we don't give him to Silas," I said. "We keep him."

"We become pirates?" Jax asked, grinning. "Real pirates?"

"Why not?" I said. "We're already criminals. Might as well be legends."

Suddenly, the ship rocked violently.

"Proximity alert!" Cas yelled. "Multiple contacts! It's Viper Squad! And they brought friends!"

I ran to the cockpit.

The viewscreen was filled with ships. A corporate blockade. A dozen interceptors and a heavy cruiser.

"Surrender the Asset," a voice hailed. It wasn't Viper. It was Silas.

"Silas?" I said. "You set us up."

"I secured my investment," Silas's voice was smooth. "You were never going to the Haven, Zero. You were bringing the prototype to me for field testing. And you passed with flying colors."

"You used us," Val said, her voice deadly calm.

"I employed you. Now, power down your engines and prepare to be boarded."

I looked at the crew. Val. Jax. Cas.

And I felt Orion in the back of my mind, pulsing with fear.

"No," I said.

"Excuse me?" Silas asked.

"I said no."

I turned to Val. "Can you fly this crate through that blockade?"

Val looked at the cruiser. She smiled. It was a terrifying smile.

"I can fly this crate through hell, Scrapper. Just keep the bugs off my windshield."

"Jax," I said. "Man the guns. Cas, jam everything."

"And you?" Val asked.

"I'm going outside," I said.

I ran to the cargo bay. I climbed into Hades.

*// READY, ZERO? //*

"Ready, Orion," I said. "Time to show them what a ghost can do."

I launched.

# Chapter 9: The Gauntlet

Space was silent, but my mind was screaming.

I was synced at 150%. The limiters were gone. I could feel every sensor contact like a touch on my skin. I could feel the heat of the fusion core like my own heartbeat.

"Targets acquired," I said.

The interceptors swarmed. They were fast, agile.

But I was faster.

I didn't fly; I *blinked*. I pushed the core, warping space-time for microseconds. One second I was here; the next I was behind them.

I swung the fusion blade. Two interceptors vanished in balls of fire.

"He's too fast!" a pilot screamed over the open channel.

"Concentrate fire!" Silas ordered.

The cruiser opened up with its main batteries. Heavy turbo-lasers.

"Val! Evasive!"

The *Rusty Nail* barrel-rolled, dodging a beam that would have vaporized a city block.

"I can't keep this up forever, Zero!" Val yelled. "We need a hole!"

"I'll make one," I said.

I turned toward the cruiser.

*// WARNING. ENERGY LEVELS CRITICAL. //*

"Divert life support to shields," I ordered. "Divert everything to the blade."

I charged.

The cruiser's point-defense cannons lit up the void. I wove through the fire, taking hits. My armor melted. Alarms screamed.

But I held the flow.

I reached the cruiser. I didn't attack the hull. I attacked the bridge.

I landed on the viewports. I could see the officers inside, their faces pale with terror. I could see Silas, standing calm, watching me.

I raised the blade.

"Transaction denied," I whispered.

I didn't strike the glass. I struck the shield generator emitter on the hull next to it.

The cruiser's shields collapsed.

"NOW!" I screamed. "Val! Hit the engines!"

The *Rusty Nail* shot past me, diving into the hole I’d created in the formation.

I jumped off the cruiser, firing my thrusters to catch up.

"Zero!" Cas yelled. "You have three missiles locked on you!"

"I know."

I spun in mid-air. I didn't try to outrun them. I used the blade.

*Slash. Slash. Slash.*

Three explosions bloomed behind me.

I grabbed the *Rusty Nail*’s airlock clamp as it flew past.

"Gotcha!" Jax yelled, engaging the mag-locks.

We dragged the Titan into the slipstream.

"Jump!" I yelled.

The stars stretched into lines.

We were gone.

# Chapter 10: The Void

We dropped out of slipspace in deep space. No stars. Just the black.

I powered down the mech. The cockpit went dark.

I sat there for a long time, listening to the cooling fans. My nose was bleeding. My hands wouldn't stop shaking.

*// ZERO. ARE YOU DAMAGED? //*

"I'm okay, Orion," I whispered. "Just... tired."

I climbed out.

The crew was waiting in the cargo bay.

Val looked at the scorched armor of the Titan. Then she looked at me. She crossed her arms, trying to look stern, but her lip twitched.

"You're insane," she said. "Reckless. Unprofessional. A complete liability."

She walked over and shoved a bottle of water into my chest.

"Drink," she muttered, looking at the floor. "You look like garbage. And... good flying. I guess."

"I learned from the best," I said.

"Don't push it," she snapped, her cheeks flushing slightly. "I still outrank you."

Jax slapped me on the back, nearly knocking me over. "Did you see his face? Silas looked like he swallowed a lemon!"

Cas was typing furiously on her datapad. "Kill-Creds are trending #1 in the sector. We're famous, boys. I'm already licensing the footage to three different underground newsfeeds. We might actually turn a profit on this disaster."

"What now?" Jax asked.

"Now," I said, looking at the Titan. "We disappear. We find the Pirate Haven. We fix Orion. And then..."

"Then?" Val asked.

"Then we go back," I said. "And we burn the rest of them down."

As if on cue, the comms panel lit up. A single, encrypted text message.

**SENDER: SILAS**
**MESSAGE: You passed the test, Zero. But the tuition is due. See you in the black.**

I deleted the message.

I walked to the airlock window. The void was vast, cold, and indifferent. But for the first time in a long time, I didn't feel small.

I felt dangerous.

I tapped the glass.

"We are the Human Trigger," I whispered. "And the safety is off."
