# Chapter 9: The Gauntlet

Zero launched into the void. Synced at 150%.

The interceptors swarmed. He *blinked*, warping space-time. He swung the fusion blade. Two interceptors vanished in balls of violet fire.

"Concentrate fire!" Silas ordered.

The cruiser fired turbo-lasers. Val barrel-rolled the *Rusty Nail*.

"I need a hole!" Val yelled.

"I'll make one."

Zero charged the cruiser, weaving through point-defense fire. He landed on the bridge viewports. He saw Silas.

"Transaction denied," Zero whispered.

He struck the shield generator. Shields collapsed.

"NOW!"

The *Rusty Nail* shot past. Zero jumped off, slashing three missiles that locked onto him.

Jax grabbed him with the mag-locks.

"Jump!"

We were gone.
