# Chapter 2: The Meat Grinder

The memory tasted of sulfur and ozone, a phantom sting that bit harder than the Sector 4 vents. Zero watched the bot’s cooling fluids pool on the deck plates and saw Rook’s blood instead.

"You’re grinding the rail again, Zero," Rook had said. He was leaning against the airlock of the *High-Roller*, buffing the white ceramic finish of a Cognis smart-carbine with a piece of silk. "You’ll polish that steel into a needle before we even dock."

Zero didn't stop the rhythmic scrape of the whetstone. "The magnetic track on the saya has a three-millisecond delay. If the handshake fails, I need the friction to be zero. I don't trust the magnets. I don't trust the ship. And I definitely don't trust that bone-white toy in your lap."

Rook tapped the glowing green 'Sanctified' seal on the carbine’s receiver. It pulsed with a rhythmic, haptic beat—a "digital heartbeat" synced to his own. "Cognis engineering says this tracks a heartbeat through a meter of reinforced concrete. To me, it's a lullaby. No AI. Just my intent, amplified. This job is my ticket to the **Upper Ring**. No more smog. No more recycled water. Real sunlight, Zero. A future."

"It’s the Accountability Mandate, Rook," the scrapper said, looking up. The whetstone went silent. "That digital heartbeat is the sound of a ticking clock. The law requires every weapon to phone home to a Cognis server before it fires. That gun is a leash. The tech was designed to monitor you, not empower you. If Cognis decides your pulse is a liability, that weapon bricks. It’s not yours. It’s theirs."

"Then it’s a good thing we’re the best contractors they’ve got," Kilo called out from the back, her hands buried in the guts of a thermite charge. "Silas, tell the boy the math. He’s making me nervous with that 'doomsday' talk."

Silas didn't turn from the pilot’s console. He sat rigid, his eyes glazed in the milky-white sheen of a deep-data trance. Unlike the others, Silas was a "Pure," his brain genetically tuned for data-processing rather than augmented with chips. "The route is verified. The Cognis Treasury Vault is holding three tons of physical bearer bonds. Untraceable. The security mesh is on a sub-routine loop. There are no variables. Only the payout."

"There’s always a variable," Zero muttered. He slid the Lobotomizer into the saya. *SNAKT.* The magnetic lock caught with a heavy, industrial thud.

The *High-Roller* banked hard through the acid-rain smog of Sector 1, its triple-engine turbo jets gliding through the clouds like an electric eel through dark water. Its thermal masking engines hummed a low, undetectable vibrato, intaking superheated steam and blasting it out in a slick, aerodynamic wake. Below them, the sprawl was a canyon of neon and misery, but ahead, the *Golden Spire* pierced the cloud layer like a needle of pure avarice. It was a monolith of gilded durasteel, the headquarters of the Cognis Treasury, wreathed in a perpetual halo of pressurized steam vents that kept the plebeian atmosphere from corroding its shine.

Silas brought them in on a silent vector, docking the transport at a service port usually reserved for waste disposal. The airlock cycled with a hiss of decontamination gas.

The transition to the *Golden Spire* was a blur of pressurized steam and the metallic tang of recycled air.

"Perimeter active," Kilo whispered, her voice a ghost over the sub-vocal comms. She moved ahead, a wraith in matte-grey cam-weave. Two corporate sentries stood by the lift cluster, their helmets scanning for thermal signatures.

"View's garbage from this deck," one guard muttered, his voice filtered through a cheap vox-caster. "Nothing but smog and scrubbers."

"Quit whining," the second guard replied, checking his pulse rifle. "The pay is Diamond-Tier and the dental plan covers augment rejection. I'd stare at a brick wall for twenty years if it meant my kids didn't have to drink recycled water."

"Fair point," the first guard sighed. "Still... wouldn't mind seeing the sun once in a—"

Kilo ignored her sidearm. She flicked a ceramic coin into the far corner. As the helmets turned, she moved. A mono-filament garrote snapped tight. No sound. No struggle. Just the soft thud of bodies hitting the carpet. "Lift clear. Zero, you're up."

Zero stepped over the bodies, checking his corners. "Too easy."

"Silas jammed the local sensors," Rook said, his confidence radiating like heat. "Smooth is fast."

Then the lift doors chimed. A squad of heavy-response troops poured out, shields raised.

"Contact!" Rook yelled.

The hallway erupted. Rook dropped to one knee, the white Cognis carbine singing a high-pitched, staccato rhythm. *Thwip-thwip-thwip.* The "Sanctified" tracking system was flawless. Every round found a gap in the armor—neck, visor, knee joint. Rook moved with the fluid grace of a dancer, trusting the digital heartbeat of his weapon implicitly. He dropped three guards in two seconds. "Oscar Mike to the vault! I can smell the ocean breeze already! We're not FUBAR yet!"

Alarms blared—a rhythmic, deafening klaxon. Red lights washed the gold walls in blood.

"Vault access in ten seconds!" Kilo shouted, slapping a breaching charge onto the massive blast doors. "Cover me!"

Zero deflected a stray plasma bolt with the flat of his sheath, the magnetic field sparking. He didn't waste movement. He drew the Odachi in a blur of motion—a lateral draw that decapitated the guard rushing him. The blade hummed, hungry. He pivoted, slashing through the receiver of the next guard's rifle and the armor plating beneath, the superheated edge searing the wound instantly. He kicked off a marble pillar, using the momentum to drive the heavy blade through the chest of a third attacker who turned to run. It wasn't flashy; it was efficient. It was butchery.

"Charge set!" Kilo yelled. "Blow it!"

Then the klaxons cut out. The lights died. The gunfire stopped.

The world was silent.

Rook screamed as the weapon let out a pathetic, electronic whine. The green seal turned a jagged, pulsing red. The Cognis firmware locked the firing pin and dumped the entire thermal load of the power cell into the cooling vents at once. The white ceramic turned a scorching, blister-inducing black in Rook's hands. He was holding a localized meltdown designed to maim the "unauthorized."

"My HUD," Rook gasped, stumbling as his targeting optics—linked to the carbine's sensors—dissolved into grey static. "I’m blind! The Mandate... it’s revoking my permissions!"

"Abort!" Zero screamed, but the comms were dead.

"Zero!" Rook yelled, pointing toward the docking bay viewport. "The *High-Roller*! It's dusting off!"

Zero looked. The ship was already undocking, its engines flaring blue as it peeled away into the smog. "Silas," he growled.

"He cut the comms!" Kilo shouted, frantically tapping her wrist unit. "We're jammed!"

"No," Zero said, looking at his own flickering HUD. "This isn't a jammer. It's a local EMP targeting our specific gear IDs. We've been burned."

Then the ceiling vents hissed open.

The 'Cleaners' unfolded from the vents with a terrifying, frictionless grace—no hydraulic hiss, no mechanical whine. Just the wet, heavy slap of bare, carbon-grafted feet on the deck plates. They were silent hunters in a world of screaming machines. Seven-foot-tall biological anomalies fueled by synthetic hemoglobin and skin grafted with sub-dermal carbon mesh. No cybernetics. No hackable limbs. Just raw, genetically-perfected violence.

"Sniper!" Rook screamed, diving behind a gold bullion transport crate.

A flechette burst caught him mid-air. Without his armor's active-integrity fields—which had also bricked—the ceramic plates shattered like glass. The needles turned his torso into a spray of red mist before he even hit the ground.

Kilo didn't even scream; a sniper round from the high gallery took her before she could touch the det-cord.

Zero dove, sliding behind a heavy durasteel pillar as the corridor filled with death. A Cleaner turned toward him, its unnaturally pale eyes tracking him with the cold focus of a predator. It raised a sidearm, the barrel spinning up.

Zero leaned into the "Flow." He slammed the trigger on the Lobotomizer's hilt, engaging the weapon's broadcast mode. The unshielded coils acted as a high-gain antenna. He dropped a Logic-Bomb that forced a recursive handshake error on the Cleaner's weapon. The sidearm groaned, its Cognis firmware locking the trigger in a safety-loop.

The Cleaner dropped the useless gun and reached for a combat knife, its genetically-enhanced muscles coiling like high-tension cables. It was faster than any human, but it was a close-quarters predator. It needed to be within three feet to end him.

Zero had five.

He pivoted from behind the pillar, the Lobotomizer clearing the saya in a massive, horizontal sweep. The five-foot arc of violet plasma created a literal "no-man's land." The Cleaner tried to change its vector mid-air, its hyper-reflexes screaming, but the Odachi’s reach was an inescapable geometric fact.

The blade boiled through the sub-dermal mesh and the heart beneath. The Cleaner’s synthetic blood didn't spray—it turned into a toxic, purple steam the moment it hit the ionizing edge. The massive sword sheared the creature in half at the waist.

The upper torso, driven by momentum and genetically engineered rage, continued its trajectory. The claws raked across Zero's chest as the half-corpse flew past. The impact threw Zero sideways, slamming him into the wall. He gasped, checking his kimono. The armor-weave was shredded, a deep gouge running from shoulder to hip, but the skin beneath was only bruised.

The violet glow of the superheated Odachi reflected in the pooling blood of the two halves lying on the floor, a jagged neon scar carved into the deck plates.

Zero didn't wait to see if the others were following. He pulled a flash-bang from his belt—analog, reliable—and tossed it into the center of the room. *BANG.*

White light flooded the corridor. Zero sprinted, blindly following the memory of the schematics toward the waste disposal chute. He dove into the dark, sliding down three levels of teflon-coated tubing until he hit the refuse pile in the sub-basement.

He lay there for a long time in the dark, smelling of ozone and garbage, listening to the distant alarms. Rook was gone. Kilo was gone. The payout was gone.

He was a ghost now.

***

*Three Months Later...*

The Sector 4 slums were a good place to disappear. Zero adjusted his grip on the Lobotomizer, the familiar weight the only thing grounding him. He’d spent the last ninety days scrubbing his digital footprint, living off scrap and low-level bounties, waiting for the heat to die down.

But the heat never really died. It just waited for you to make a mistake.

"Heads up, Samurai," Cas's voice chirped in his ear—a new voice, a new contract, a new beginning. "I spent three weeks decrypting their patrol algorithms to find this gap, so try not to waste my time..."

Zero smirked, tapping his temple. The game hadn't changed. Just the players.
