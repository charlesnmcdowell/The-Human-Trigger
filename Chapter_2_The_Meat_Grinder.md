# Chapter 2: The Meat Grinder

The heist was supposed to be a "Milk Run." That was the first mistake. In the Jovian belt, milk curdles before it hits the glass.

Zero’s old crew, the *Neon Jackals*, were pros, or at least they billed themselves that way. There was **Rook**, the team lead, a man who treated every mission brief like a sermon, his voice heavy with the gravity of a preacher who had seen the devil and stolen his wallet. He had found Zero starving in a sub-level transit hub two years ago and had given him a burger, a blanket, and a purpose. And there was **Kilo**, the demolitionist, a woman whose laugh sounded like breaking glass and who wore enough high-explosive ordnance to level a city block as casual jewelry. She had taught Zero how to dance—literally, in a dingy bar on Ganymede—and how to hotwire a mag-lev train.

They were his family. And in the Jovian shadow, family was the only currency that didn't devalue.

They stood in the airlock of the *Golden Spire*, a corporate transport drifting in the shadow of Callisto. Zero’s HUD flashed green.

"Systems green. Cameras are looped," Zero whispered, his fingers dancing over the holographic interface projected from his wrist. "You have a five-minute window before the handshake protocol resets. Don't waste it."

Rook clapped a heavy hand on Zero’s shoulder. "Keep the door open, kid. We’ll be back before you can miss us."

"Just get the payload," Zero said, his eyes scanning the scrolling code. "And try not to blow anything up unless you have to, Kilo."

Kilo winked, patting the satchel charge on her hip. "No promises, Samurai."

They moved out, silent shadows against the pristine white of the corporate corridor. Zero stayed behind, the digital gatekeeper. He watched them on the monitors, ghosting through the ship’s interior. It was beautiful, in a way—the precision, the silence. They were artists of theft.

But art doesn't stop a bullet.

The ambush didn't start with a bang; it started with a glitch.

On Zero’s screen, the feed flickered. One second, Rook and Kilo were moving toward the vault, their movements relaxed, confident. Kilo was making a hand sign at the camera—a rude gesture aimed at the corporate security chief she assumed was asleep at the wheel. The next, the corridor was flooded with blinding white light.

"Contact!" Rook’s voice tore through the comms, distorted by static. "It’s a trap! They knew we were coming!"

"Abort!" Zero screamed, his hands flying across the controls. "Get out of there! I’m unlocking the—"

"Negative!" Rook barked, the sound of gunfire erupting in the background. "We’re pinned! EMP! My gear is—"

The transmission cut to a scream of feedback. On the monitor, Zero watched in horror as the pristine white walls turned into a slaughterhouse.

Corporate security didn't use stunners. Not for this. The *Golden Spire* wasn't just a transport; it was a floating bank vault for the megacorps of the Inner Planets. They protected their assets with high-velocity flechette rounds that shredded armor and flesh alike.

Rook’s "sanctified" smart-gun, a top-tier piece of tech linked to his biometric ID, locked up instantly under the localized EMP blast. It was a failsafe designed to prevent unauthorized use, but the corporate jammer had tricked the gun’s logic core into thinking it was being hacked. He was trying to reboot it, shouting commands that went unheard, when the first volley hit him. He jerked like a marionette with cut strings, red blooming across his chest. He fell trying to shield Kilo with his body.

Kilo tried to detonate her charges, to create a breach, a distraction, anything. But the detonators were wireless, linked to the localized mesh network. Dead air. She pulled a manual pin, screaming something defiant, her face a mask of fury, but a sniper round took her in the throat before she could throw it.

She fell, the charge rolling harmlessly away.

Zero stood in the airlock, frozen. The silence in his headset was louder than the gunfire had been. He could still hear Kilo’s laugh. He could still feel the weight of Rook’s hand on his shoulder.

*They’re gone.*

The realization hit him like a physical blow, punching the air from his lungs. The crew he’d run with for two years, the people who had taught him how to blend in at a high-society gala and how to patch a bullet wound with duct tape and superglue—gone in ten seconds. Because of a microchip. Because of a line of code.

Then, the airlock door hissed.

Zero spun, his hand going to his katana.

The door didn't open for his friends. It opened for the cleanup crew.

Three figures stepped through the steam. They wore the matte-black armor of Corporate Black-Ops, faceless helmets reflecting the red emergency lights. They moved with the terrifying coordination of a single organism.

"Target identified," the lead soldier said, his voice a digitized rasp. "The Hacker. Secure him."

They raised their weapons. Standard issue pulse-rifles. Efficient. Deadly.

Zero looked at them. He looked at the monitors where his friends lay dead in a pool of their own blood, betrayed by the very technology they trusted.

He looked at his hand, resting on the hilt of his thermal katana. A weapon made of scrap. A weapon that had no circuit board, no biometric lock, no "off" switch controlled by a corporate server.

Rook’s gun had failed him. Kilo’s bombs had failed her.

Zero’s blade would not fail.

"Secure this," Zero whispered.

He didn't wait for them to fire. He moved.

The "Flow" took him again, but this time, it wasn't cold. It was an inferno. He closed the distance before the lead soldier could depress the trigger. The thermal blade flashed, a scream of light in the confined space.

The soldier’s rifle was sliced in half. The soldier followed a second later.

The other two opened fire. Zero didn't dodge; he became the wind. He slid under a burst of plasma fire, feeling the heat singe his hair. He came up spinning, the katana a whirlwind of red death.

He didn't fight with honor. He fought with grief. He fought with the rage of a boy from the Scrap-Vats who had just watched the only family he had left get butchered by a spreadsheet decision.

He carved through the armor, through the flesh, through the lies.

When it was over, Zero stood alone in the airlock, surrounded by three corpses. The alarm was blaring now, a klaxon wail that echoed through the ship.

He looked at the monitor one last time. Rook and Kilo were still there, still dead.

"I’m sorry," he whispered to the screen.

He turned and ran. Not back to his ship—they would be waiting there. He ran deeper into the *Golden Spire*, into the unknown, carrying nothing but his grief and a blade that burned as hot as his hate.
