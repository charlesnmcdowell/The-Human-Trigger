# Chapter 2: The Meat Grinder

The memory tasted of sulfur and ozone, a phantom sting that bit harder than the Sector 4 vents. Zero watched the bot’s cooling fluids pool on the deck plates and saw Rook’s blood instead.

"You’re grinding the rail again, Zero," Rook had said. He was leaning against the airlock of the *High-Roller*, buffing the white ceramic finish of a Cognis smart-carbine with a piece of silk. "You’ll polish that steel into a needle before we even dock."

Zero didn't stop the rhythmic scrape of the whetstone. "The magnetic track on the saya has a three-millisecond delay. If the handshake fails, I need the friction to be zero. I don't trust the magnets. I don't trust the ship. And I definitely don't trust that bone-white toy in your lap."

Rook tapped the glowing green 'Sanctified' seal on the carbine’s receiver. It pulsed with a rhythmic, haptic beat—a "digital heartbeat" synced to his own. "It feels me, Zero. The Mandate's promise. Cognis engineering says this tracks a heartbeat through a meter of reinforced concrete. To me, it's a lullaby. No AI. Just my intent, amplified. This job is my ticket to **Platinum Status**. Real medical coverage. A future."

"It’s the Accountability Mandate, Rook," the scrapper said, looking up. The whetstone went silent. "That digital heartbeat is the sound of a ticking clock. The law requires every weapon to phone home to a Cognis server before it fires. That gun is a leash. The tech was designed to monitor you, not empower you. If Cognis decides your pulse is a liability, that weapon bricks. It’s not yours. It’s theirs."

"Then it’s a good thing we’re the best contractors they’ve got," Kilo called out from the back, her hands buried in the guts of a thermite charge. "Silas, tell the boy the math. He’s making me nervous with that 'doomsday' talk."

Silas didn't turn from the pilot’s console. He sat rigid, his eyes glazed in the milky-white sheen of a deep-data trance. Unlike the others, Silas was a "Pure," his brain genetically tuned for data-processing rather than augmented with chips. "The route is verified. The vault's security mesh is on a sub-routine loop. There are no variables. Only the payout."

"There’s always a variable," Zero muttered. He slid the Lobotomizer into the saya. *SNAKT.* The magnetic lock caught with a heavy, industrial thud.

The transition to the *Golden Spire* was a blur of pressurized steam and the metallic tang of recycled air.

"Perimeter active," Kilo whispered, her voice a ghost over the sub-vocal comms. She moved ahead, a wraith in matte-grey cam-weave. Two corporate sentries stood by the lift cluster, their helmets scanning for thermal signatures. Kilo ignored her sidearm. She flicked a ceramic coin into the far corner. As the helmets turned, she moved. A mono-filament garrote snapped tight. No sound. No struggle. Just the soft thud of bodies hitting the carpet. "Lift clear. Zero, you're up."

Zero stepped over the bodies, checking his corners. "Too easy."

"Silas jammed the local sensors," Rook said, his confidence radiating like heat. "We're ghosts."

Then the lift doors chimed. A squad of heavy-response troops poured out, shields raised.

"Contact!" Rook yelled.

The hallway erupted. Rook dropped to one knee, the white Cognis carbine singing a high-pitched, staccato rhythm. *Thwip-thwip-thwip.* The "Sanctified" tracking system was flawless. Every round found a gap in the armor—neck, visor, knee joint. Rook moved with the fluid grace of a dancer, trusting the digital heartbeat of his weapon implicitly. He dropped three guards in two seconds, his laugh echoing over the channel. "Platinum Status, baby! They can't touch us!"

Alarms blared—a rhythmic, deafening klaxon. Red lights washed the gold walls in blood.

"Vault access in ten seconds!" Kilo shouted, slapping a breaching charge onto the massive blast doors. "Cover me!"

Zero deflected a stray plasma bolt with the flat of his sheath, the magnetic field sparking. They were winning. It was precise. It was perfect. They reached the vault threshold, the adrenaline singing in their veins.

"Charge set!" Kilo yelled. "Blow it!"

Then the klaxons cut out. The lights died. The gunfire stopped.

The world was silent.

Rook screamed as the weapon let out a pathetic, electronic whine. The green seal turned a jagged, pulsing red. The Cognis firmware locked the firing pin and dumped the entire thermal load of the power cell into the cooling vents at once. The white ceramic turned a scorching, blister-inducing black in Rook's hands. He was holding a localized meltdown designed to maim the "unauthorized."

"My HUD," Rook gasped, stumbling as his targeting optics—linked to the carbine's sensors—dissolved into grey static. "I’m blind! The Mandate... it’s revoking my permissions!"

"Abort!" Zero screamed, but the comms were dead.

"The math changed, Rook," Silas’s voice echoed once over the emergency channel, sounding thin and far away. "Cognis offered a **Diamond-Tier** Debt-Correction. A clean slate for my family. I’m just balancing the ledger."

Then the ceiling vents hissed open.

The 'Cleaners' unfolded from the vents with a terrifying, frictionless grace—no hydraulic hiss, no mechanical whine. Just the wet, heavy slap of bare, carbon-grafted feet on the deck plates. They were silent hunters in a world of screaming machines. Seven-foot-tall biological anomalies fueled by synthetic hemoglobin and skin grafted with sub-dermal carbon mesh. No cybernetics. No hackable limbs. Just raw, genetically-perfected violence.

A flechette burst caught Rook in the chest. Without his armor's active-integrity fields—which had also bricked—the ceramic plates shattered like glass. The needles turned his torso into a spray of red mist. Kilo didn't even scream; a sniper round from the high gallery—Silas’s perch—took her before she could touch the det-cord.

Zero stood in the center of the slaughter. A Cleaner turned toward him, its unnaturally pale eyes tracking him with the cold focus of a predator. It raised a sidearm, the barrel spinning up.

Zero leaned into the "Flow." He slammed his mind into the room's mesh, dropping a Logic-Bomb that forced a recursive handshake error on the Cleaner's weapon. The sidearm groaned, its Cognis firmware locking the trigger in a safety-loop.

The Cleaner dropped the useless gun and reached for a combat knife, its genetically-enhanced muscles coiling like high-tension cables. It was faster than any human, but it was a close-quarters predator. It needed to be within three feet to end him.

Zero had five.

He pivoted, the Lobotomizer clearing the saya in a massive, horizontal sweep. The five-foot arc of violet plasma created a literal "no-man's land." The Cleaner tried to change its vector mid-air, its hyper-reflexes screaming, but the Odachi’s reach was an inescapable geometric fact.

The blade boiled through the sub-dermal mesh and the heart beneath. The Cleaner’s synthetic blood didn't spray—it turned into a toxic, purple steam the moment it hit the ionizing edge.

The violet glow reflected in the pooling blood, a jagged neon scar. The skin on Zero's forearms prickled and reddened—instant UV burns from the dirty blade.

Rook had wanted a legacy. He’d found a ledger instead.
