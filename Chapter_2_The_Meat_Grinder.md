# Chapter 2: The Meat Grinder

The memory tasted of sulfur and **static charge**, a phantom sting that bit harder than the Sector 4 vents. Zero watched the bot’s cooling fluids pool on the deck plates and saw Rook’s blood instead.

"You’re grinding the rail again, Zero," Rook had said. He was leaning against the airlock of the *High-Roller*, buffing the white ceramic finish of a Cognis smart-carbine with a piece of silk. "Think you'll be done jacking that thing off before we even dock?"

Zero didn't stop the rhythmic scrape of the whetstone. "The magnetic track on the saya has a three-millisecond delay. I need the friction to be zero. I don't trust the magnets. I don't trust the ship. And I definitely don't trust that bone-white toy in your lap."

Rook tapped the glowing green 'Soul-Locked' seal on the carbine’s receiver. It pulsed with a rhythmic, haptic beat—a "digital heartbeat" synced to his own. "Cognis engineering says this tracks a heartbeat through a meter of reinforced concrete. No AI. Just my intent, amplified. This job is my ticket to the **Upper Ring**. No more smog. No more recycled water. Real sunlight, young man. A worthwhile retirement plan."

"It’s that damn Accountability Mandate, Rook," the scrapper said, looking up. The whetstone went silent. "The law requires every weapon to phone home to a Cognis server before it fires. That gun is a leash. The tech was designed to monitor you, not empower you. If Cognis decides your pulse is a liability, that weapon bricks. It’s not yours. It’s theirs."

"Then it’s a good thing we’re the best contractors they’ve got," Kilo called out from the back, her hands buried in the guts of a thermite charge. "Silas, tell the boy the math. He’s making me nervous with that 'doomsday' talk."

Silas didn't turn from the pilot’s console. He sat rigid, his eyes glazed in the milky-white sheen of a deep-data trance. Unlike the others, Silas was a "Pure," his brain genetically tuned for data-processing rather than augmented with chips. "The route is verified. We are hitting the primary geothermal coupler for the 'Helios-7' Manufacturing Spire. Our client wants the facility offline for eighteen months. The security mesh is on a sub-routine loop. There are no variables. Only the payout."

"There’s always a variable," Zero muttered. He slid the Lobotomizer into the saya. *SNAKT.* The magnetic lock caught with a heavy, industrial thud.

The *High-Roller* fired its maneuvering thrusters, drifting sideways through the **hydrocarbon** smog of Sector 1. Its triple-engine turbo jets pulsed, fighting the thin atmosphere like an electric eel thrashing in dark water. Its thermal masking engines hummed a low, undetectable vibrato, intaking superheated **gas** and blasting it out in a slick, aerodynamic wake. Below them, the sprawl was a canyon of neon and misery, but ahead, the *Golden Spire* pierced the cloud layer like a needle of pure avarice. It was a monolith of gilded durasteel, the headquarters of the Cognis Treasury, wreathed in a perpetual halo of pressurized steam vents that kept the plebeian atmosphere from corroding its shine.

Silas brought them in on a silent vector, docking the transport at a service port usually reserved for waste disposal. The airlock cycled with a hiss of decontamination gas.

The transition to the *Golden Spire* was a blur of pressurized steam and the metallic tang of recycled air.

"Perimeter active," Kilo whispered, her voice a ghost over the sub-vocal comms. She moved ahead, a wraith in matte-grey cam-weave. Two corporate sentries stood by the lift cluster, their helmets scanning for thermal signatures.

"I can't see shit from this deck," one guard muttered, his voice filtered through a cheap vox-caster. "Nothing but smog, I could piss in the wind and not see the stream."

"Quit whining," the second guard replied, checking his pulse rifle. He was one of the voluntary debt-slaves who sold their faces to the company for a clean slate. "The pay is at least five times your average wage slave working in one of the world spanning mega cities, and the benefits coverage would see your next of kin sitting pretty if anything was to happen. I'd stare at a brick wall for twenty years if it meant my kids could afford a **Hab-Block** in the orbital ring."

"Fair point," the first guard sighed. "Still... wouldn't mind seeing the sun once in a—"

Kilo ignored her sidearm. She moved with the silent, fluid grace of a spider, descending from the ceiling on a mono-filament line. Her stealth field shimmered, blending perfectly with the smog. As the rear guard turned, she yanked him upward. The garrote snapped tight around his throat, cutting off his scream before it started. His legs twitched helplessly in the air, his eyes rolling back to expose white orbs as the wire bit deep, saliva and blood running down his chin. She secured the anchor, leaving him suspended like a gruesome ornament.

The front guard turned, sensing the movement, but saw nothing. He scanned the empty corridor, his rifle raised. He looked up too late. Kilo dropped behind him, her hand clamping over his mouth as a vibro-blade punched through his armor and into his spine. "Lift clear. Zero, you're up."

Zero stepped over the bodies, checking his corners. "I'm close enough to check the network for vulnerabilities and make sure we don't pop up on any sensors."

"No need, our man Silas jammed the local sensors," Rook said, his confidence radiating like heat. "Sit back and watch us pros work kid, Smooth is fast."

Then the lift doors chimed. A squad of heavy-response troops poured out, shields raised.

"Contact!" Rook yelled.

The hallway erupted. Rook dropped to one knee, the white Cognis carbine singing a high-pitched, staccato rhythm. *Thwip-thwip-thwip.* The carbine's tracking system was flawless. Every round found a gap in the approaching guards' armor—neck, visor, knee joint. Rook moved with the urgency of a trained soldier, trusting the digital readouts of his rifle's scope implicitly. His helmet's visor pointed out targets faster than a normal human eye could register.

The first guard's right knee exploded, the round bypassing the standard armor of an expendable employee of **Orbital Dynamics**—Cognis's main rival. The second shot found the guard's right occipital orb and exploded out the back of his helmet, silencing him forever. The third guard's left elbow shattered, dislodging the bone and eliciting a pained scream as his rifle veered off target, spraying rounds into the wall. A follow-up shot crashed through his mouth, shattering teeth and sending him reeling to the floor. The fourth guard took a hit to the side, stumbling as Rook's sixth bullet found its mark, jerking him back as he slumped dead.

"We need to move those pretty asses to the vault people!" Rook shouted, reloading. "The situation is going tits up and we need to be out of here before everything is fucked beyond repair, which is yesterday!"

Alarms blared—a rhythmic, deafening klaxon. Red lights washed the gold walls in blood.

"Vault access in ten seconds!" Kilo shouted, slapping a breaching charge onto the massive blast doors. "Cover me!"

Zero deflected a stray plasma bolt with the flat of his sheath, the magnetic field sparking. He didn't waste movement. He drew the Odachi in a blur of motion—a lateral draw that decapitated the guard rushing him. The blade hummed, hungry. He pivoted, slashing through the receiver of the next guard's rifle and the armor plating beneath, shearing the guard horizontally in half. The superheated edge seared the wound instantly as the lower half hit the floor knees first, the upper half rolling across the ground groaning in shock. The third guard, terrified, sprayed and prayed but missed every shot. Zero kicked off a marble pillar, using the momentum to drive the heavy blade through the chest of the attacker who was turning to run.

"Charge set to 15 mins!" Kilo yelled. "Let's Delta, before the reactor turns this place into a hellscape!" Rook replied.

Then the klaxons cut out. The lights died. The gunfire stopped.

The world was silent.

Rook screamed as the weapon and his helmet let out a pathetic, electronic whine. The green seal on the carbine turned a jagged, pulsing red. The Cognis firmware locked and the equipment went offline.

"My HUD," Rook gasped, stumbling as his targeting optics—linked to the carbine's sensors—dissolved into grey static. "Um, either my pants is witnessing a malfunctioning turd cutter, or my rifle is offline."

"Switching to proximity chat, I have gear for situations like this when connection is knocked out, I'll cover the team's six as we exfil!" Zero yelled without using comms.

"Zero!" Rook yelled, pointing toward the docking bay viewport. "The *High-Roller*! It's dusting off!"

Zero looked. The ship was already undocking, its engines flaring blue as it peeled away into the smog. "Silas," he growled.

"Can Silas do that?" Zero said, looking around for a new exit strategy.

Then the ceiling vents hissed open.

The 'Cleaners' unfolded from the vents with a terrifying, frictionless grace—no hydraulic hiss, no mechanical whine. Just the wet, heavy slap of bare, carbon-grafted feet on the deck plates. They were silent hunters in a world of screaming machines. Seven-foot-tall biological anomalies fueled by synthetic hemoglobin and skin grafted with sub-dermal carbon mesh. No cybernetics. No hackable limbs. Just raw, genetically-perfected violence.

"Cleaners!" Rook screamed, diving behind a transport crate.

A Cleaner's frantic rush caught him mid-air. Without his armor's active-integrity fields—which had also bricked—the ceramic plates shattered like glass. The long rake turned his torso into a spray of red mist before he even hit the ground.

Kilo, no longer camouflaged, didn't even scream. A Cleaner's massive form emerged from the high gallery and took her before she could touch the det-cord, followed by yells of anguish and gurgling blood as it eviscerated her body, splattering entrails across the ground.

Zero dove, sliding behind a heavy durasteel pillar as the corridor filled with death. A Cleaner turned toward him, its unnaturally pale eyes tracking him with the cold focus of a predator.

Zero leaned into the "Flow." *Remember your training.* He saw it in slow motion—the Cleaner coming at him with a wild fury of claws, unrefined but brutal. He parried the claw with his sheath, simultaneously flashing the heated blade out to dismember the monstrosity's arm. He spun to duck the remaining claw and slammed the Odachi samurai-style behind him past his left side, rolling forward to bisect the creature behind him. Its two pieces fell to the floor. Emerging from the roll, Zero continued into a sprint, flashing the blade once again to behead the foe savaging Kilo's dead form on his way to Rook.

He reached Rook just in time to vertically slice the Cleaner in the midst of disemboweling him. Rook looked up with bloody teeth, holding his stomach, slumped against the pillar. "Listen kid, you got to get out of here... there's no time. I'm recommending a new exfill. You have to find the garbage disposal and exfil into the wastes. It'll be dangerous but there are people that have built a massive city around the factory and call that place home. I'm recommending you steal transport and delta out of here, this place is huge and you'll need to clear the area unless you want to meet up with me at the pearly gates."

Zero didn't have time to argue. A different type of Cleaner—this one female, humanoid, and decked out in leather-like gear—pulled up in a hover-transport, surrounded by drones. She was curvaceous, almost pornographic in her design—like an OnlyFans model built for murder. She looked amused at Zero's sheathed Odachi as he slowly stood up from Rook's dying form, keeping his eyes trained on her. The drones hovered like paparazzi, recording the scene. She threw her pistol to the ground and began to brandish two massive, electrified combat daggers, beckoning Zero to attack. Her genetically-enhanced muscles coiled like high-tension cables.

"Nice recording rig," Zero spat, his hand resting on the hilt of the Odachi. "Hope your subscribers like snuff films, because I'm not dying today."

Rook gurgled a bloody laugh behind him. "Damn kid... you think you're a real bad ass... get the fuck out of here."

Zero judged the distance. She was fast—faster than any human. A close-quarters predator. She needed to be within three feet to end him.

Zero had five.

He pivoted from behind the pillar, the Lobotomizer clearing the saya in a massive, horizontal sweep. The five-foot arc of violet plasma created a literal "no-man's land." The lady assassin remained still, studying the blade's vector mid-air, her hyper-reflexes twitching as she became a blur.

The blade whistled through the air, but instead of feeling his blade hit sub-dermal mesh and heart, Zero noticed the Cleaner was gone. She was behind him, one dagger plunged into the heart of the shocked Rook, who looked up at her chest in mild amusement, dying with a grin on his face as the light left his eyes. Her other dagger was held nonchalantly against her waist as she looked down at the dying man. Zero, awkwardly stuck in a samurai slash pose thinking he came out the victor, slowly turned around to see the display of Rook's death.

Immediately, Zero dove into the vehicle, using his quick-hack ability to override the ignition and speed off. The lady laughed maniacally into the air as he fled, her drones falling behind the vehicle to record the mad dash through obstacles and the ensuing chase of the factory guards in their roamers.

The chase was a blur of neon and adrenaline. Zero pushed the stolen transport to its limit, weaving through the labyrinthine spires of the factory complex. He smashed through a glass atrium, flying through the lobby of an administrative building, the vehicle smoking and sparking.

Then, the world turned white.

Kilo's charge detonated. The primary geothermal coupler blew, sending a shockwave through the entire spire. The blast was silent in the vacuum outside, but inside the atmosphere of the factory, it was a thunderclap that shattered every window for five miles. The Helios-7 Manufacturing Spire groaned, its structural supports failing as the foundation was vaporized.

The chaos was absolute. The security grid crashed. The drones chasing him faltered, caught in the EMP backlash of the reactor failure.

"Payment delivered, Silas," Zero muttered through gritted teeth, using the confusion to lose the last of the roamers.

He kept the vehicle going remotely while manually escaping through the building on foot, sliding down maintenance chutes and sprinting down stairwells, killing a few panicked guards on the way with precise, desperate strikes.

Once out into the street, he blended with the masses. He managed to grab some clothes at a nearby shop, changing in an alley and quick-hacking the local security feed to loop his image. He disappeared into the unwashed asses of the masses, eventually collapsing against a wall in a dark alley.

It was only then that he noticed the pain. She had gotten him. A clean cut against the left side of his midriff. He laid back, bleeding out a bit, staring up at the smog-choked sky.

He lay there for a long time in the dark, smelling of **burnt plastic** and garbage, listening to the distant alarms. Rook was gone. Kilo was gone. The payout was gone.

He was a ghost now.

***

*Three Months Later...*

The Sector 4 slums were a good place to disappear. Zero adjusted his grip on the Lobotomizer, the familiar weight the only thing grounding him. He’d spent the last ninety days scrubbing his digital footprint, living off scrap and low-level bounties, waiting for the heat to die down.

But the heat never really died. It just waited for you to make a mistake.

"Heads up, Samurai," Cas's voice chirped in his ear—a new voice, a new contract, a new beginning. "I spent three weeks decrypting their patrol algorithms to find this gap, so try not to waste my time..."

Zero smirked, tapping his temple. The game hadn't changed. Just the players.
