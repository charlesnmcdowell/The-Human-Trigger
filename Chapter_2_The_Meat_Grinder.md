# Chapter 2: The Meat Grinder

The memory tasted of sulfur and ozone, a phantom sting that bit harder than the Sector 4 vents. Zero watched the bot’s cooling fluids pool on the deck plates and saw Rook’s blood instead.

"You’re grinding the rail again, Zero," Rook had said. He was leaning against the airlock of the *High-Roller*, buffing the white ceramic finish of a Cognis smart-carbine with a piece of silk. "You’ll polish that steel into a needle before we even dock."

Zero didn't stop the rhythmic scrape of the whetstone. "The magnetic track on the saya has a three-millisecond delay. If the handshake fails, I need the friction to be zero. I don't trust the magnets. I don't trust the ship. And I definitely don't trust that bone-white toy in your lap."

Rook tapped the glowing green 'Sanctified' seal on the carbine’s receiver. It pulsed with a rhythmic, haptic beat—a "digital heartbeat" synced to his own. "It feels me, Zero. The Human Trigger. Cognis engineering says this tracks a heartbeat through a meter of reinforced concrete. To me, it's a lullaby. No AI. Just my intent, amplified."

"It’s the Accountability Mandate, Rook," Zero said, looking up. The whetstone went silent. "That digital heartbeat is the sound of a ticking clock. The 'law' is a line of code in a Cognis server. That gun is a leash. The Human Trigger wasn't meant to empower you; it was meant to monitor you. If Cognis decides your pulse is a liability, that weapon bricks. It’s not yours. It’s theirs."

"Then it’s a good thing we’re the best contractors they’ve got," Kilo called out from the back, her hands buried in the guts of a thermite charge. "Silas, tell the boy the math. He’s making me nervous with that 'doomsday' talk."

Silas didn't turn from the pilot’s console. He sat rigid, his eyes glazed in the milky-white sheen of a deep-data trance. Unlike the others, Silas was a "Pure," his brain genetically tuned for data-processing rather than augmented with chips. "The route is verified. The vault's security mesh is on a sub-routine loop. There are no variables, Zero. Only the payout."

"There’s always a variable," Zero muttered. He slid the Lobotomizer into the saya. *SNAKT.* The magnetic lock caught with a heavy, industrial thud.

The transition to the *Golden Spire* was a blur of pressurized steam and the metallic tang of recycled air. They moved through the corridors like shadows—until they hit the vault threshold. The world didn't explode. It went silent.

Rook didn't just drop the gun; he screamed. The weapon let out a pathetic, electronic whine, and the green seal turned a jagged, pulsing red. But the Cognis firmware didn't just lock the firing pin; it dumped the entire thermal load of the power cell into the cooling vents at once. The white ceramic turned a scorching, blister-inducing black in Rook's hands. He wasn't just holding a club; he was holding a localized meltdown designed to maim the "unauthorized."

"My HUD," Rook gasped, stumbling as his targeting optics—linked to the carbine's sensors—dissolved into grey static. "I’m blind! The Mandate... it’s revoking my permissions!"

"Abort!" Zero screamed, but the comms were dead.

"The math changed, Rook," Silas’s voice echoed once over the emergency channel, sounding thin and far away. "Cognis offered a Debt-Correction. A clean slate for my family. I’m just balancing the ledger."

Then the ceiling vents hissed open.

The 'Cleaners' didn't drop; they unfolded from the vents. They moved with a terrifying, frictionless grace—no hydraulic hiss, no mechanical whine. Just the wet, heavy slap of bare, carbon-grafted feet on the deck plates. They were silent hunters in a world of screaming machines. Seven-foot-tall biological anomalies with hyper-oxygenated blood and skin grafted with sub-dermal carbon mesh. No cybernetics. No hackable limbs. Just raw, genetically-perfected violence.

A flechette burst caught Rook in the chest. Without his armor's active-integrity fields—which had also bricked—the ceramic plates shattered like glass. The needles turned his torso into a spray of red mist. Kilo didn't even scream; a sniper round from the high gallery—Silas’s perch—took her before she could touch the det-cord.

Zero stood in the center of the slaughter. A Cleaner turned toward him, its unnaturally pale eyes tracking him with the cold focus of a predator. It raised a sidearm, the barrel spinning up.

Zero leaned into the "Flow." He slammed his mind into the room's mesh, dropping a Logic-Bomb that forced a recursive handshake error on the Cleaner's weapon. The sidearm groaned, its Cognis firmware locking the trigger in a safety-loop.

The Cleaner didn't panic. It dropped the gun and reached for a combat knife, its genetically-enhanced muscles coiling like high-tension cables. It was faster than any human, but it was a close-quarters predator. It needed to be within three feet to end him.

Zero had five.

He pivoted, the Lobotomizer clearing the saya in a massive, horizontal sweep. The five-foot arc of violet plasma created a literal "no-man's land." The Cleaner tried to change its vector mid-air, its hyper-reflexes screaming, but the Odachi’s reach was an inescapable geometric fact.

The blade didn't cut; it boiled through the sub-dermal mesh and the heart beneath. The Cleaner’s hyper-oxygenated blood didn't spray—it turned into a toxic, purple steam the moment it hit the ionizing edge.

The violet glow reflected in the pooling blood, a jagged neon scar. The skin on Zero's forearms prickled and reddened—instant UV burns from the dirty blade.

Rook had wanted a legacy. He’d found a ledger instead.
