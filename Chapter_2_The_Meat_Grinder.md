# Chapter 2: The Meat Grinder

The heist was supposed to be a "Milk Run." In the Jovian belt, milk curdles before it hits the glass.

Zero's old crew, the *Neon Jackals*, were pros. **Rook**, the team lead, treated every mission brief like a sermon. **Kilo**, the demolitionist, wore high-explosive ordnance like jewelry.

They stood in the airlock of the *Golden Spire*. Zero checked his deck, verifying the loop on the camera feeds. The code scrolled across his retinal display—green, clean, and looped. "Systems green. Five-minute window."

Rook checked the action on his smart-gun, the sanctified tech humming with a bio-metric handshake. "Keep the door open, kid."

Kilo patted the satchel charge on her hip, wiring the detonator with a pair of delicate, silver pliers. "No promises on the noise, Samurai."

They moved out. Zero stayed behind, the digital gatekeeper. He watched them on the monitors, ghosting through the ship’s interior.

The ambush started with a glitch.

The feed flickered. One second, relaxed movement. The next, blinding white light.

"Contact!" Rook’s voice tore through the comms. "It’s a trap!"

"Abort!" Zero screamed, hands flying across the controls, trying to override the blast doors.

"Negative! We’re pinned! EMP!"

The transmission cut to feedback. On the monitor, the pristine white walls turned into a slaughterhouse.

Corporate security used high-velocity flechette rounds. Rook’s "sanctified" smart-gun locked up under the EMP. He fell trying to shield Kilo. Kilo tried to pull a manual pin, but a sniper round took her in the throat.

She fell, the charge rolling away.

Zero stood in the airlock, frozen. *They’re gone.*

The airlock door hissed.

Zero spun, hand going to his katana. He thumbed the activation stud, feeling the magnetic coils charge.

Three Corporate Black-Ops soldiers stepped through the steam.

"Target identified," the lead soldier rasped. "The Hacker. Secure him."

They raised their pulse-rifles.

Zero looked at his hand on the hilt. A weapon made of scrap. No circuit board. No "off" switch.

"Secure this," Zero whispered.

He moved. The "Flow" took him—an inferno. He closed the distance. The thermal blade flashed.

The soldier’s rifle was sliced in half. The soldier followed.

The other two opened fire. Zero became the wind, sliding under a burst of plasma. He came up spinning, the katana a whirlwind of red death.

He fought with the rage of a boy from the Scrap-Vats. He carved through the armor, through the flesh.

When it was over, Zero stood alone in the airlock, surrounded by three corpses. The alarm blared.

He looked at the monitor one last time. Rook and Kilo were still there.

"I’m sorry," Zero whispered.

He turned and ran deeper into the *Golden Spire*.
