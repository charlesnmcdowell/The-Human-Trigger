# Chapter 5: The Haywire Graveyard

The white light of the neural sync collapsed into the jagged static of a rejected handshake. The AI screamed, a digital shriek tearing through Zero's frontal lobe.

*// UNRECOGNIZED USER. PURGE PROTOCOL INITIATED. //*

"Denied," Zero gritted out, his teeth clenched against the phantom pain of his synapses misfiring. It felt like trying to download a **Diamond-Tier** connectome through a copper wire. "Handshake override."

*// AUTHORIZATION INVALID. BIOMETRIC MISMATCH. //*

The mech was trying to cook his brain. It was designed to consume a human mind, not host one. Zero fought the code with *feeling*, visualizing the radioactive sludge of the Scrap-Vats, the chaotic rhythm of the Flow. He didn't ask for permission; he forced his consciousness into the machine's architecture like a pry-bar.

*// ANOMALY DETECTED. SYNC ESTABLISHED. //*

His eyes snapped open. The cockpit dissolved. He *became* the Titan. He felt the fusion core beating in his chest, the hydraulic fluid pumping through his veins, the thick armor plating serving as a second skin.

"Green board," Zero said, his voice echoing in the metallic skull of the machine.

"We've got company," Val's voice crackled over the comms, sharp and urgent. "Corporate security is breaching the bay doors. Move the Asset!"

Zero willed the machine forward. The NSFW-32 moved with a heavy, terrifying grace. He stepped out of the containment hold just as a squad of Centurions formed a firing line.

"Hades," Zero whispered, tasting the name. "Let's dance."

He drew the fusion blade. It was a skyscraper of sharpened tungsten wrapped in a containment field, humming with the power of a small star.

The Centurions opened fire. Bullets sparked harmlessly off his matte-black hull, buzzing like angry flies.

Zero moved. The Scrapper’s Flow translated perfectly through the neural link. He sidestepped a rocket with the agility of a duelist and brought the massive blade down in a thunderous arc. The deck plating split with a scream of tearing metal. The Centurions didn't just break; they evaporated in the thermal wash.

"Holy..." Jax breathed over the channel.

"Asset secured," Zero said. He engaged the jump-jets, the sudden g-force slamming him into the pilot's couch as the Titan launched itself onto the cargo ramp of the *Rusty Nail*.

"Punching it!" Val yelled.

The ship lurched, fusion drives screaming as they blasted out of the dock and into the void.

***

The *Rusty Nail* cut its main torch, drifting into the shadow of the **Haywire Graveyard**, a radioactive reef of shattered warships and orbital debris. It was a place where sensors went to die and ghosts came to hide.

"We need to calibrate," Zero said, his voice sounding thin in the quiet cockpit. "Hades is running hot."

He walked the Titan onto the hull of a derelict dreadnought, the magnetic clamps in the mech's feet locking onto the rusted iron. He dove deep into the code, burning through safety protocols with his mind, stripping away the limiters that Cognis had installed.

*// WARNING. CORE INTEGRITY AT RISK. //*

"Trust me," Zero whispered to the machine.

He pushed the core to the redline, feeling the heat bleed into the cockpit.

*// SYNCHRONIZATION: 120%. //*

A warning klaxon blared in the ship's cockpit.

"Proximity alert!" Cas yelled. "Contacts emerging from the debris!"

Three Void-Shark skiffs drifted out of the shadows, their jagged hulls painted with tribal warnings. Scavengers. Bottom feeders.

"Live-fire exercise," Zero said, the fusion blade igniting with a snap-hiss that vibrated through the hull.
