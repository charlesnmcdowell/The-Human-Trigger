# Chapter 5: The Haywire Graveyard

The white faded to static.

*// UNRECOGNIZED USER. PURGE PROTOCOL INITIATED. //*

The AI screamed in Zero's frontal lobe.

"Denied," Zero gritted out. "Handshake override."

*// AUTHORIZATION INVALID. //*

He fought the code with *feeling*. He visualized the Scrap-Vats. The flow. He pushed that sensation into the link.

*// ANOMALY DETECTED. SYNC ESTABLISHED. //*

His eyes snapped open. He *was* the Titan.

"Green board," Zero said.

"We've got company," Val crackled. "Move the Asset!"

Zero walked the NSFW-32 out. A squad of Centurions formed a firing line.

"Hades," Zero whispered. "Let's dance."

He drew the fusion blade. A skyscraper of sharpened tungsten.

The Centurions fired. Bullets sparked off his hull.

He moved. The Scrapper’s Flow translated. He sidestepped a rocket and brought the blade down. The floor split. The Centurions evaporated.

"Holy..." Jax breathed.

Zero engaged jump-jets and landed on the *Rusty Nail*.

"Punching it!" Val yelled.

We blasted into space.

"What do we call you?" Zero asked the empty cockpit.

*// DESIGNATION: NS-FW-32. //*

"How about... Hades?"

*// DESIGNATION ACCEPTED. //*

***

We emerged in the **Haywire Graveyard**. A debris field of shattered warships.

"We need to calibrate," Zero said. "Hades is running hot."

He walked Hades onto a derelict dreadnought. He went deep into the code, burning through safety protocols with his mind.

*// WARNING. CORE INTEGRITY AT RISK. //*

"Trust me."

He pushed the core to the redline.

*// SYNCHRONIZATION: 120%. //*

Warning klaxon.

*// PROXIMITY ALERT. //*

Three Void-Shark skiffs emerged from the debris.

"Live-fire exercise," Zero said.
