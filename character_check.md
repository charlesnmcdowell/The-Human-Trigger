# Character Voice Check: "The Coffee Incident"

**Setting:** The *Rusty Nail* galley. 0300 Ship Time.
**Context:** Zero is trying to fix the coffee machine. It is not going well.

***

**Zero:** (Staring at the machine, holding a screwdriver like a dagger) "I defeated a Centurion with a sword. Why can't I defeat a percolator with a screwdriver?"

**Cas:** (Hanging upside down from the top bunk, chewing gum) "Because the Centurion had a logic core. That machine runs on spite and burnt beans. Also, you're trying to bypass the safety lock. Again."

**Zero:** "The safety lock is a suggestion. I need caffeine, not a lecture on appliance ethics. I'm expensing this mental anguish, by the way."

**Val:** (Walking in, impeccable in a fresh flight suit, holding a datapad) "You're not expensing anything until we pay for the fuel you wasted drifting in the Graveyard. And get that screwdriver out of the heating element. You'll short the grid."

**Zero:** "It's called 'percussive maintenance', Princess. And for the record, that drift saved us three seconds on the intercept."

**Val:** (Blushing slightly, looking at the floor) "It was... adequate piloting. Reckless. Stupid. But... the vector was clean. Just don't do it again. You look like garbage when you pull high-G maneuvers."

**Jax:** (Looming in the doorway, blocking the light) "Move."

**Zero:** "Jax, help me out here. Tell Val that my coffee repair methods are sound."

**Jax:** (Gently moves Zero aside with one massive, robotic hand. Taps the machine once, hard, on the side. The machine immediately starts brewing.) "Percussive maintenance requires precision, kid. Not rage."

**Cas:** "Ooh, burn. I'm minting that. 'The Human Trigger defeated by a kitchen appliance.' That's gotta be worth at least fifty credits on the blooper reel. *Baka samurai.*"

**Val:** (Trying to hide a smile behind her datapad) "Make it sixty. I want a copy."

**Zero:** (Sighing, watching the coffee drip) *"Watashi wa sore o rikai shimashita.* I understood that, Cas."

**Cas:** "Dang. I forgot the translator module was active. I owe you a soda."

**Jax:** "I understand thirsty. Move. My cup is bigger."
