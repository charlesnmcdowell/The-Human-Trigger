# Chapter 1: The Scrapper’s Flow

The blade Zero called 'The Lobotomizer' gave off a low-frequency snarl that vibrated in the marrow of his teeth. It was an Odachi—a massive, two-handed Katana with five feet of overclocked plasma-edge. Zero’s hands, mapped with thick, iron-tough callouses from a decade of extreme training, gripped the abrasive carbon-braid of the hilt with a steady, lethal calm. He wore a battered armored kimono of nano-carbon leather, reinforced with lead-lined plates to absorb the radiation from his own weapon. On his left forearm, a bulky, jury-rigged energy shield emitter hummed with a faint blue static, and a tactical "Oni-Menpo" rebreather mask covered the lower half of his face, its lateral fangs hissing as they scrubbed the toxic smog of the sector.

Sector 4 stank of the unwashed asses of the masses—a thick, cloying cocktail of recycled sweat, open sewers, and the metallic tang of dying machinery. Below the rusted catwalks of the abandoned hydroponics bay, a black-market "Doll-Clinic" was in full swing. Through the rising steam, Zero saw a line of 'Cyber-Sirens'—high-end sex dolls with porcelain-white skin and vacant stares—hooked to overhead rails like sides of beef in a slaughterhouse.

"Just another Tuesday in paradise, right Samurai?" Cas's voice chirped in his ear, casual as if she were ordering takeout. "This mark is standard. Retrieve the core, don't die. We've been doing this dance for six months, and you still haven't told me which dumpster you crawled out of. Not that I mind. 'Solo' looks good on your resume, and it means I get to sit here in my beanbag chair, three miles away, sipping a slushie while you breathe in cancer. Win-win."

Zero looked down at the loading bay. "You should see the livestock, Cas. Fresh batch of 'Gents and Ladies' getting crated up. Porcelain skin, vacant eyes. Looks like a big order for the Upper Ring."

"Don't kink-shame the Pures, Zero," Cas laughed, the sound tinny in his ear. "Those 'Dolls' signed the contract. Five years of service, zero memory, and their student loans vanish. It's the Corporate Dream with a personality wipe. Besides, the pay is better than stripping. And taking out this illegal 'Soul-Butcher' operation is exactly why the Dispatcher hired us. Cognis wants their competition removed without getting their own hands dirty."

"They're hanging like sides of beef," Zero muttered, watching a warehouse worker carelessly shove a limp, college-aged girl into a shipping container. "And the Pures will just use them up and toss them down the chute."

"That's the economy, baby. Now stop ogling the merchandise. You have a target."

Two miles above this filth, the Upper Ring pierced the smog—a gilded spire of ivory and neon where the beautiful lived in perpetual ecstasy. Here, in the shanty-shadows, the only thing that glittered was the blood.

Zero’s target was a Cognis 'Enforcer-Executioner'. The seven-foot-tall mass of serrated armor and twitchy hydraulics was currently busy. It had a local scrapper by the throat, lifting him three feet off the deck. With a sickening, wet crunch, the bot’s hydraulic pincer collapsed the man’s ribcage. A mist of hot, iron-scented blood sprayed across the floor, coating the nearby dolls in a fine red glaze.

"Heads up, Samurai," Cas continued. "I spent three weeks decrypting their patrol algorithms to find this gap, so try not to waste my time. That's a Centurion Mark-IV. Manufactured by Cognis Heavy Industries. Retail price: more than your entire life's earnings. Their firewall is 'Sanctified' grade, meaning it phones home to the corporate servers every 0.4 seconds to check if it has permission to kill you. Don't let it make that call."

"Sanctified Grade? Angels don't carry gatling guns." Zero whispered, tapping his temple where the illegal jack sat. "I need to be within five meters for the handshake override. Close enough to smell the grease."

"Sanctified means it's 'Soul-Verified', genius," Cas corrected, her voice dripping with mock-patience. "It means that hunk of metal has a real-time poor son of a doll somewhere accountable for its actions—probably some gig-economy pilot in the Upper Ring managing fifty bots at once. But you're about to clog that handshake with junk data, aren't you? A 'Logic-Bomb'. It's going to panic the weapon. The pilot's screen is just going to show a spinning 'Connection Lost' wheel while you turn his asset into scrap."

Zero was perched on a rusted catwalk twenty feet above the kill-zone, the metal grating biting into his knees. Below him, the Centurion's sensors swept the hydroponics bay in a fan of hard light, illuminating the rotting vines and the black sludge bleeding from the walls. The air was thick with humidity and assaulted his nostrils like the breath of a dying engine—sulfur, rot, and the copper tang of recycled air. Zero tightened his grip on the railing, his knuckles white under the lead-lined gloves. Hopping onto the railing with perfect balance he peered down at the massive bot.

*Breathe. Sync. Drop.*

He tipped forward, dropping face-first into the void. Gravity took the lead, wind whipping his purple locs back like a kinetic contrail. Mid-air, he visualized the local mesh—a chaotic web of RF handshakes tethering the Centurion to the Cognis overmind. He twisted, flipping 180 degrees. He didn't cut; he reversed the polarity of the sheath-magnets, using the bulkhead's own ferrous skeleton to brake his fall with a scream of magnetic resistance. Suspended for a microsecond in the magnetic cushion, he channeled the Logic-Bomb through the sword’s straining coils, using the weapon as a broadcast antenna to blast the bot's receiver with a petabyte of recursive junk data. The neural feedback hit him instantly—a copper taste flooding his mouth and a sharp, blinding spike behind his eyes. Zero scowls, "Like a fucking ice cream headache."

He hit the deck plates with a magnetic *thud* that shook the dust from the air. Cas replied, "You say something?" The Centurion swiveled instantly, its single optic eye contracting from search-yellow to kill-purple.

"Unauthorized bio-sig. Handshake failed. Attempting reconnect to Cognis Control..."

"You won't find them," Zero muttered, wiping blood from his nose. "I just DDoSed your soul."

The bot’s Gatling arm spun up, but the firing mechanism hesitated, cycling through error codes. Zero dropped his center of gravity. He used the heavy, lead-lined sheath as a shield, deflecting the bot's swinging limb. The impact rattled his teeth, the magnetic drag of the bot's frame pulling at the metal of his sheath.

"Get off me," Zero grunted.

He twisted his hips. The Centurion matched him, its massive pincer clamping onto his shoulder. Metal groaned against the armor-weave of his kimono. He leaned into the grip, driving his elbow into the bot's optical sensor. Glass shattered.

He triggered the release.

SNAKT.

The Odachi cleared the sheath magnets, and the hydroponics bay turned into an ultraviolet hellscape. The air delaminated, blistering under the heat. The five-foot blade shrieked at 140 decibels, the sound of the staged induction coils fighting to keep the plasma edge from expanding and consuming Zero himself. An ionizing amethyst light erupted from the oversized steel, casting harsh, jagged shadows. Zero’s photo-reactive kimono flashed into a chrome-violet mirror, reflecting the lethal radiation away from his body.

Zero swung the massive weapon, steering a five-foot high-voltage arc. As the blade moved, it left a "plasma-wake" in the air—a shimmering trail of **ionized gas** that stayed burned into the retinas.

He drove the blade upward. The Lobotomizer didn't melt the bot’s waist; it sublimated it. The 3,000-degree edge turned the metal directly into dust with a sharp *CRACK* of vacuum displacement. The thermal bloom was so intense that the deck plates beneath the bot’s feet began to slag, but the floor an inch away remained cool and solid.

Momentum carried him past the ruin. He came up in a crouch, his skin prickling from the UV radiation bleeding off the leaking blade—a nasty sunburn he'd feel for days. The heat-sinks on the sword's hilt glowed a dull, angry orange.

The Centurion stood there, its optic flickering as the Logic-Bomb finally bricked its higher functions. The top half slid slowly to the left and hit the floor with a wet, metallic thud.

Silence rushed back into the corridor, ringing in Zero's deafened ears.

Zero tapped his comms bead. "Cas. Tell me you got the money shot."

"Clean rip," Cas confirmed, her voice crackling with satisfaction. "I saw the transfer hit the shell account before the bot even hit the floor. The client wanted stealth, sure, but they also wanted results. And honestly? Watching you turn a million-credit war machine into scrap metal is way more entertaining than a ghost run. Though, maybe next time try not to alert the entire sector? Just a thought."

"If I ghost it, I can't salvage the servos," Zero said, kicking a piece of the bot's chassis. "The bonus on these hydraulics will cover my rent for a month."

"Got it? Escrow released. The funds are already bouncing through three shell accounts," Cas continued. "But seriously, Zero? A frontal assault? We've been running these ops for two years, and you still fight like you have **Diamond-Tier life insurance** money to have your most recent memories and skills beamed back to life via **Orbital-Link** to clone."

Zero popped the seal on a stim-injector. "No need for a backup clone when you don't plan on dying, Cas."

"Says the **larper** in god-damn samurai armor," Cas shot back.

"You're right though, If that bot was running the new patch, I'd be a smear on the wall," Zero muttered, slapping the cooling catch on his hilt. He knelt by the ruined chassis, his vibro-knife working to pry the glowing fusion cell from its housing. "So, are we rich yet?"

"Solvent for forty-eight hours. Now move. The heat just spiked. We have unknown signatures on long-range."

Zero sprinted, the violet afterimage of the kill still burning in his eyes, his hands shaking from the feedback of the containment coils—a weapon that was a bottled meltdown fighting to get out.
