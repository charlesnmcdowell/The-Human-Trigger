# Chapter 1: The Scrapper’s Flow
The blade Zero called 'The Lobotomizer' hungry-growled against the magnetic lock of the saya. It was an Odachi—a massive, two-handed field sword with a blade length that bordered on the suicidal. Zero felt the vibration in his molars, a violet-hot itch demanding to be scratched. His hands suffered from "White Finger"—a permanent, low-level tremor caused by the unshielded magnetic induction coils lining the blade's spine.

Sector 4 smelled of sulfur and wet rust—the scent of a ship dying slowly. It was an abandoned hydroponics bay, the walls slick with black mold that ate radiation and bled sludge onto the deck plates. Below Zero, the Centurion-class enforcement bot prowled through the overgrown, rotting vines like a metallic panther. The Cognis logo—a stylized eye trapped in a crosshair—gleamed on its chassis under the flicker of dying emergency lights.

Zero checked his thermal readout. 98%. The unshielded plasma edge would burn at 3,000 Kelvin. Far from corporate-standard, this was a piece of industrial salvage he'd stripped of every limiter that kept a user from being cooked alive by their own weapon. He was here for one thing: the payout. The Class-4 Micro-Fusion Cell beating inside the bot’s chest contained enough refined Helium-3 to power a slum-sector for a month. A mid-level fixer for the Void-Sharks had put a bounty on these specific cores—likely to retrofit their aging fleet of scavenged ships. They didn't ask questions about where the hardware came from, which made them Zero's favorite kind of client.

His pulse hammered against his ribs. He prepared the Logic-Bomb in his neural deck.

"Heads up, Samurai," Cas's voice chirped in his ear, overlaying the bot's schematic on his HUD. "I spent three weeks decrypting their patrol algorithms to find this gap, so try not to waste my time. That's a Centurion Mark-IV. Manufactured by Cognis Heavy Industries. Retail price: more than your entire life's earnings. Their firewall is 'Sanctified' grade, meaning it phones home to the corporate servers every 0.4 seconds to check if it has permission to kill you. Don't let it make that call."

"Sanctified Grade? I doubt anything's angelic about their tech. Alright, Cognis," Zero whispered, tapping his temple where the illegal jack sat. "Let's see how your servers like a recursive paradox."

"Sanctified means it's 'Soul-Verified', genius," Cas corrected, her voice dripping with mock-patience. "It means that hunk of metal has a real-time handshake with the central servers. It's the Accountability Mandate in action—no trigger pulls without a verified human soul on the other end to take the legal rap. But you're about to clog that handshake with junk data, aren't you? A 'Logic-Bomb'. It's going to panic the weapon. It'll stall, waiting for an authorization that you're currently DDoSing into oblivion."

Zero was perched on a rusted catwalk twenty feet above the kill-zone, the metal grating biting into his knees. Below him, the Centurion's sensors swept the hydroponics bay in a fan of hard light, illuminating the rotting vines and the black sludge bleeding from the walls. The air was thick with humidity and the smell of ozone. Zero tightened his grip on the railing, his knuckles white under the lead-lined gloves. Hopping onto the railing with perfect balance he peered down at the massive bot. 

*Breathe. Sync. Drop.*

He tipped forward, dropping face-first into the void. Gravity took the lead, wind whipping his purple locs back like a kinetic contrail. Mid-air, he visualized the local mesh—a chaotic web of RF handshakes tethering the Centurion to the Cognis overmind. He twisted, flipping 180 degrees to drive the Lobotomizer into the bulkhead wall.

The blade shrieked as its magnetic field bit into the metal, slowing his fall in a shower of sparks. Simultaneously, he channeled the Logic-Bomb through the sword’s unshielded coils, using the weapon as a broadcast antenna to blast the bot's receiver with a petabyte of recursive junk data. The neural feedback hit him instantly—a copper taste flooding his mouth and a sharp, blinding spike behind his eyes. A "Data-Hangover" in the making.


He hit the deck plates with a magnetic *thud* that shook the dust from the air. The Centurion swiveled instantly, its single optic eye contracting from search-yellow to kill-purple.

"Unauthorized bio-sig. Handshake failed. Attempting reconnect to Cognis Control..."

"You won't find them," Zero muttered, wiping blood from his nose. "I just DDoSed your soul."

The bot’s Gatling arm spun up, but the firing mechanism hesitated, cycling through error codes. Zero dropped his center of gravity. He used the heavy, lead-lined sheath as a shield, deflecting the bot's swinging limb. The impact rattled his teeth, the magnetic drag of the bot's frame pulling at the metal of his sheath.

"Get off me," Zero grunted.

He twisted his hips. The Centurion matched him, its massive pincer clamping onto his shoulder. Metal groaned against the armor-weave of his kimono. He leaned into the grip, driving his elbow into the bot's optical sensor. Glass shattered.

He triggered the release.

SNAKT.

The Lobotomizer cleared the sheath, and the hydroponics bay turned into an ultraviolet hellscape. The air delaminated, blistering under the heat. The five-foot blade shrieked at 140 decibels, the sound of the staged induction coils fighting to keep the plasma edge from expanding and consuming Zero himself. A violent, ionizing violet light erupted from the oversized steel, casting harsh, jagged shadows.

Zero swung the massive weapon, steering a five-foot high-voltage arc. As the blade moved, it left a "plasma-wake" in the air—a shimmering trail of violet ozone that stayed burned into the retinas.

He drove the blade upward. The Lobotomizer boiled through the bot’s waist with no resistance, only the sound of high-pressure hydraulic fluid flash-vaporizing into a toxic, purple mist. The thermal bloom was so intense that the deck plates beneath the bot’s feet began to slag, turning red-hot in a perfect semi-circle.

Momentum carried him past the ruin. He came up in a crouch, his skin prickling from the UV radiation bleeding off the unshielded blade—a nasty sunburn he'd feel for days. The heat-sinks on the sword's hilt glowed a dull, angry orange.

The Centurion stood there, its optic flickering as the Logic-Bomb finally bricked its higher functions. The top half slid slowly to the left and hit the floor with a wet, metallic thud.

Silence rushed back into the corridor, ringing in Zero's deafened ears.

Zero tapped his comms bead. "Cas. Tell me you got the money shot."

"Got it? Escrow released. The funds are already bouncing through three shell accounts," Cas’s voice crackled. "But seriously, Zero? A frontal assault? We've been running these ops for two years, and you still fight like you have **Diamond-Tier coverage**."

"If I had Diamond coverage, I'd have a backup clone on standby," Zero quipped, wincing as he popped the seal on a stim-injector. "And he'd probably be smarter than me."

"He'd definitely be better looking," Cas shot back. "But the point stands. If you were **Platinum**, an armed extraction team would be dropping in to stabilize your vitals right now. Out here? We rely on 'CRISPR-Cascade' hacks. Sure, the post-war breakthrough made printing a bio-matched liver cheap enough for any basement butcher with a vat, but scrubbing *this* much acute radiation? That requires synthetic DNA-repair enzymes, and those aren't cheap. Freedom is expensive, Samurai."

"If that bot was running the new patch, I'd be a smear on the wall," Zero muttered, slapping the cooling catch on his hilt. He knelt by the ruined chassis, his vibro-knife working to pry the glowing fusion cell from its housing. "So, are we rich yet?"

"Solvent for forty-eight hours. Now move, Samurai. The heat just spiked. Viper Squad signature on long-range."

Zero sprinted, the violet afterimage of the kill still burning in his eyes, his hands shaking from the feedback of a weapon that was as much a meltdown as it was a blade.
