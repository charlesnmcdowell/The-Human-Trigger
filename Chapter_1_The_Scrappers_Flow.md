# Chapter 1: The Scrapper’s Flow

The blade didn't just hum; it *hungry-growled* against the magnetic lock of the saya. Zero Vex felt the vibration in his molars, a red-hot itch that demanded to be scratched.

Sector 4 smelled of sulfur and wet rust—the scent of a ship dying slowly. Below him, the Centurion-class enforcement bot didn't patrol; it prowled. It was a mass of corporate-grey armor and twitchy hydraulics, hunting for anything without a valid ID tag.

Zero checked his thermal readout. **98%.** Just enough juice to cut God, provided God was made of titanium alloy.

He didn't check his pulse. He knew where it was: hammering a frantic rhythm against his ribs. The fear was good. The fear kept you fast. In the Scrap-Vats of Europa, the fearless kids were the ones they shoveled into the incinerators.

*Breathe. Sync. Drop.*

He let gravity take the lead.

He hit the deck plates with a magnetic *thud* that shook the dust from the air. The Centurion swiveled instantly, its single optic eye contracting from search-yellow to kill-red.

"Unauthorized bio-sig," the bot’s vocoder buzzed, sounding like a chainsaw hitting a nail. "Compli—"

Zero didn't wait for the threats. He stepped into the kill-box.

The bot’s Gatling arm spun up—a scream of motors. Zero dropped his center of gravity, the floor slick with oil under his boots. He didn't draw the katana yet. He used the heavy, lead-lined sheath as a shield, deflecting the bot's swinging limb with a spark-showering crash.

The impact rattled Zero’s teeth, jarring his skeleton. *Stronger than the simulation.*

"Get off me," Zero grunted.

He twisted his hips, a move he’d learned dodging sorting claws in the bilge. He triggered the release.

*SNAKT.*

The thermal katana cleared the sheath. The air in the corridor instantly blistered, the temperature spiking twenty degrees. The red plasma edge wasn't a solid thing; it was a contained error in physics.

Zero didn't swing like a duelist. He swung like a butcher.

He drove the blade upward, aimed not at the armor, but at the heat-sink vent under the chassis. The Centurion tried to backpedal, but it was programmed for intimidation, not a knife fight.

The blade bit. Metal screamed—a high, wet tearing sound as the thermal edge boiled through the bot’s waist.

Zero rolled past, the heat singing the leather of his kimono. He came up in a crouch, sliding three meters, turning to face his enemy.

The Centurion stood there, optic flickering. It tried to raise its gun arm, but the hydraulics were already weeping boiling fluid onto the deck. The top half of the machine slid slowly, almost comically, to the left. It hit the floor with the sound of a dumpster falling from orbit.

Silence rushed back into the corridor, heavy and cold.

Zero exhaled, a long, shuddering breath. His hands were shaking. They always shook *after*.

He tapped his comms bead. "Cas. Tell me you recorded that."

"Recorded it?" Cas’s voice crackled in his ear, sounding bored. "I’m already editing the highlight reel. But you got sloppy on the dismount, Samurai. You let it track you for 0.4 seconds. In the real world, you're dead."

"In the real world, I'm expensive," Zero muttered, slapping the cooling catch on his hilt. "Path?"

"Clear. But the heat just spiked. You woke up the hive, Hiro. Run."

Zero didn't need telling twice. He sprinted, the red afterimage of the kill still burning in his eyes.
