Chapter 1: The Scrapper’s Flow
The blade Zero called 'The Lobotomizer' hungry-growled against the magnetic lock of the saya. It wasn't a standard katana; it was an Odachi—a massive, two-handed field sword with a blade length that bordered on the suicidal. Zero felt the vibration in his molars, a violet-hot itch demanding to be scratched. His hands suffered from "White Finger"—a permanent, low-level tremor caused by the unshielded magnetic induction coils lining the blade's spine.

Sector 4 smelled of sulfur and wet rust—the scent of a ship dying slowly. It was an abandoned hydroponics bay, the walls slick with black mold that ate radiation and bled sludge onto the deck plates. Below Zero, the Centurion-class enforcement bot prowled through the overgrown, rotting vines like a metallic panther. The Cognis logo—a stylized eye trapped in a crosshair—gleamed on its chassis under the flicker of dying emergency lights.

Zero checked his thermal readout. 98%. The unshielded plasma edge would burn at 3,000 Kelvin. It wasn't 'Sanctified'—Corporate-approved and safety-locked. It was a piece of industrial salvage he'd stripped of every limiter that kept a user from being cooked alive by their own weapon. The payout wasn't fighting gods; it was the Class-4 Micro-Fusion Cell beating inside the bot’s chest.

His pulse hammered against his ribs. He prepared the Logic-Bomb in his neural deck.

"Alright, Cognis," Zero whispered, tapping his temple where the illegal jack sat. "Let's see how your servers like a recursive paradox."

The Accountability Mandate required every legal weapon to have a real-time handshake with the central servers. It was the law that ended the AI wars: no trigger pulls without a verified human soul on the other end. But if you clogged that handshake with junk data—a 'Logic-Bomb'—the weapon panicked. It stalled, waiting for an authorization that would never come.

Breathe. Sync. Drop.

Zero triggered the packet. The neural feedback hit him instantly—a copper taste flooding his mouth and a sharp, blinding spike behind his eyes. A "Data-Hangover" in the making.

He let gravity take the lead.

He hit the deck plates with a magnetic thud. The Centurion swiveled, its optic contracting.

"Unauthorized bio-sig. Handshake failed. Attempting reconnect to Cognis Control..."

"You won't find them," Zero muttered, wiping blood from his nose. "I just DDoSed your soul."

The bot’s Gatling arm spun up, but the firing mechanism hesitated, cycling through error codes. Zero dropped his center of gravity. He used the heavy, lead-lined sheath as a shield, deflecting the bot's swinging limb. The impact rattled his teeth, the magnetic drag of the bot's frame pulling at the metal of his sheath.

"Get off me," Zero grunted.

He twisted his hips. The Centurion matched him, its massive pincer clamping onto his shoulder. Metal groaned against the armor-weave of his kimono. He leaned into the grip, driving his elbow into the bot's optical sensor. Glass shattered.

He triggered the release.

SNAKT.

The Lobotomizer cleared the sheath, and the hydroponics bay turned into an ultraviolet hellscape. The air didn't just blister; it delaminated. The five-foot blade shrieked at 140 decibels, the sound of the staged induction coils fighting to keep the plasma edge from expanding and consuming Zero himself. A violent, ionizing violet light erupted from the oversized steel, casting harsh, jagged shadows.

Zero didn't just swing it; he steered a five-foot high-voltage arc. As the blade moved, it left a "plasma-wake" in the air—a shimmering trail of violet ozone that stayed burned into the retinas.

He drove the blade upward. The Lobotomizer didn't meet the bot’s waist; it boiled through it. There was no resistance, only the sound of high-pressure hydraulic fluid flash-vaporizing into a toxic, purple mist. The thermal bloom was so intense that the deck plates beneath the bot’s feet began to slag, turning red-hot in a perfect semi-circle.

Momentum carried him past the ruin. He came up in a crouch, his skin prickling from the UV radiation bleeding off the unshielded blade—a nasty sunburn he'd feel for days. The heat-sinks on the sword's hilt glowed a dull, angry orange.

The Centurion stood there, its optic flickering as the Logic-Bomb finally bricked its higher functions. The top half slid slowly to the left and hit the floor with a wet, metallic thud.

Silence rushed back into the corridor, ringing in Zero's deafened ears.

Zero tapped his comms bead. "Cas. Tell me you got the money shot."

"Got it? I'm minting the 'Kill-Creds' as we speak," Cas’s voice crackled. "But seriously, Zero? A frontal assault? You know the Mandate doesn't cover medical for 'Ghosts' like us. Your DNA is probably screaming right now."

"If that bot was running the new patch, I'd be a smear on the wall," Zero muttered, slapping the cooling catch on his hilt. He knelt by the ruined chassis, his vibro-knife working to pry the glowing fusion cell from its housing. "So, are we rich yet?"

"Solvent for forty-eight hours. Now move, Samurai. The heat just spiked. Viper Squad signature on long-range."

Zero sprinted, the violet afterimage of the kill still burning in his eyes, his hands shaking from the feedback of a weapon that was as much a meltdown as it was a blade.
