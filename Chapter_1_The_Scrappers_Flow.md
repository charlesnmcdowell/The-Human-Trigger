# Chapter 1: The Scrapper’s Flow

The blade didn't just hum; it *hungry-growled* against the magnetic lock of the saya. Zero Vex felt the vibration in his molars, a red-hot itch that demanded to be scratched.

Sector 4 smelled of sulfur and wet rust—the scent of a ship dying slowly. It was an abandoned hydroponics bay, the walls slick with black mold that ate radiation and bled sludge onto the deck plates. Below him, the Centurion-class enforcement bot didn't patrol; it prowled through the overgrown, rotting vines like a metallic panther. It was a mass of corporate-grey armor and twitchy hydraulics, hunting for anything without a valid ID tag.

Zero checked his thermal readout. **98%.** Just enough juice to cut God, provided God was made of titanium alloy. But he wasn't here to fight gods; he was here to extract a Class-4 Micro-Fusion Cell. That fist-sized heart beating inside the bot’s chest was worth three months of clean air filters and maybe, just maybe, enough bribe money to keep the Void-Sharks off his back. Survival wasn't cheap in the shadow of Jupiter, and his rent was overdue.

He didn't check his pulse. He knew where it was: hammering a frantic rhythm against his ribs. The fear was good. The fear kept you fast, sharpening the senses until the world moved in slow motion. In the Scrap-Vats of Europa, the fearless kids were the ones they shoveled into the incinerators, their unlived lives rising as black smoke into the smog-choked sky. He carried their ghosts with him, a silent chorus reminding him that every breath was stolen property.

*Breathe. Sync. Drop.*

He let gravity take the lead.

He hit the deck plates with a magnetic *thud* that shook the dust from the air. The Centurion swiveled instantly, its single optic eye contracting from search-yellow to kill-red.

"Unauthorized bio-sig," the bot’s vocoder buzzed, sounding like a chainsaw hitting a nail. "Compli—"

"Yeah, yeah. Save the sermon for the bandwidth," Zero muttered. He didn't wait for the threats. He stepped into the kill-box.

The bot’s Gatling arm spun up—a scream of motors. He dropped his center of gravity, boots finding purchase on the oil-slicked floor. He didn't draw the katana yet. He used the heavy, lead-lined sheath as a shield, deflecting the bot's swinging limb with a spark-showering crash.

The impact rattled Zero’s teeth, jarring his skeleton. *Stronger than the simulation.*

"Get off me," Zero grunted.

He twisted his hips, a move he’d learned dodging sorting claws in the bilge. But the Centurion was faster than the old hydraulic arms. Its free hand, a massive pincer designed to crush reinforced crates, clamped onto his shoulder. The servos whined, metal groaning against the armor-weave of his kimono.

"You're making this very difficult to expense," Zero grit out. Pain flared sharp and immediate in his shoulder. He didn't pull away; that would tear the muscle. Instead, he leaned *into* the grip, driving his elbow into the bot's optical sensor. Glass shattered. The bot recoiled, its grip loosening just enough.

He triggered the release.

*SNAKT.*

The thermal katana cleared the sheath. The air in the corridor instantly blistered, the temperature spiking twenty degrees. The red plasma edge wavered like a heat mirage, a contained error in physics that distorted the light around it.

This wasn't a duel. It was butchery, fueled by the frustration of the endless grind, the corporate stranglehold, and the sheer audacity of a system rigged to crush him.

He drove the blade upward, aimed not at the armor, but at the heat-sink vent under the chassis. The Centurion tried to backpedal, but it was programmed for intimidation, not a knife fight.

The blade bit. Metal screamed—a high, wet tearing sound as the thermal edge boiled through the bot’s waist.

Momentum carried him past the ruin, the heat singing the leather of his kimono. He came up in a crouch, sliding three meters, turning to face his enemy.

The Centurion stood there, optic flickering. It tried to raise its gun arm, but the hydraulics were already weeping boiling fluid onto the deck. The top half of the machine slid slowly, almost comically, to the left. It hit the floor with the sound of a dumpster falling from orbit.

Silence rushed back into the corridor, heavy and cold.

A long, shuddering breath escaped him. His hands were shaking. They always shook *after*.

He tapped his comms bead. "Cas. Tell me you got the money shot."

"Got it? I'm practically minting the NFT right now," Cas’s voice crackled in his ear, overlaid with the frantic *clack-clack-clack* of a mechanical keyboard and the wet pop of chewing gum. "But seriously, Zero? A frontal assault on a Centurion? Do you know what the insurance premiums are on that kimono? If you die, I’m selling your organs to the lowest bidder just to cover the deductible."

"If that bot was running the new patch, I'd be a smear on the wall, and you'd be out a pilot," Zero muttered, slapping the cooling catch on his hilt. The bravado felt hollow, a mask he wore to hide the trembling in his fingers. He knelt by the ruined chassis, his vibro-knife working quickly to pry the glowing fusion cell from its housing. It was warm to the touch, humming with contained power. He pocketed it, feeling the weight of his survival against his hip. "So, are we rich yet, or do I need to scrap the legs too?"

"Rich is a strong word. Let's go with 'solvent for the next forty-eight hours.' Now move your ass, Samurai. The heat just spiked. You woke up the hive, Zero. Run."

Zero didn't need telling twice. He sprinted, the red afterimage of the kill still burning in his eyes.
