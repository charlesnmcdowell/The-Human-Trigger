# Chapter 1: The Scrapper’s Flow

The Lobotomizer hungry-growled against the magnetic lock of the saya. Zero felt the vibration in his molars, a violet-hot itch demanding to be scratched. His hands suffered from "White Finger"—a permanent, low-level tremor caused by the unshielded magnetic coils of his gear.

Sector 4 smelled of sulfur and wet rust—the scent of a ship dying slowly. It was an abandoned hydroponics bay, the walls slick with black mold that ate radiation and bled sludge onto the deck plates. Below Zero, the Centurion-class enforcement bot prowled through the overgrown, rotting vines like a metallic panther. The Cognis logo—a stylized eye trapped in a crosshair—gleamed on its chassis, a reminder of the Accountability Mandate that governed the system.

Zero checked his thermal readout. **98%.** The plasma edge would burn at 3,000 Kelvin. The payout wasn't fighting gods; it was the Class-4 Micro-Fusion Cell beating inside the bot’s chest.

His pulse hammered against his ribs. He prepared the Logic-Bomb in his neural deck. It wasn't a sophisticated hack; it was a brute-force scream of junk data designed to clog the "Sanctified" handshake between the bot and the Cognis servers.

*Breathe. Sync. Drop.*

Zero triggered the packet. The neural feedback hit him instantly—a copper taste flooding his mouth and a sharp, blinding spike behind his eyes. A "Data-Hangover" in the making.

He let gravity take the lead.

He hit the deck plates with a magnetic *thud*. The Centurion swiveled, its optic contracting.

"Unauthorized bio-sig. Mandate Violation detected. Zero Vex: Status—Ghost."

"Save the sermon," Zero muttered, wiping blood from his nose.

The bot’s Gatling arm spun up. Zero dropped his center of gravity. He used the heavy, lead-lined sheath as a shield, deflecting the bot's swinging limb. The impact rattled his teeth.

"Get off me," Zero grunted.

He twisted his hips. The Centurion matched him, its massive pincer clamping onto his shoulder. Metal groaned against the armor-weave of his kimono.

"You're making this difficult to expense," Zero grit out. The headache from the Logic-Bomb was blinding, fracturing his vision. He leaned *into* the grip, driving his elbow into the bot's optical sensor. Glass shattered.

He triggered the release.

*SNAKT.*

The Lobotomizer cleared the sheath. The air blistered. A violent, ionizing violet light erupted, casting harsh shadows against the moldy walls. The blade shrieked at 140 decibels, a sound felt in the bone rather than heard.

Zero drove the blade upward. The violet plasma boiled through the bot’s waist. Hydraulic fluid sprayed like arterial blood, hissing as it hit the hot floor.

Momentum carried him past the ruin. He came up in a crouch, his skin prickling from the UV radiation bleeding off the unshielded blade.

The Centurion stood there, optic flickering as the Logic-Bomb finally bricked its higher functions. The top half slid slowly to the left and hit the floor.

Silence rushed back into the corridor, ringing in Zero's deafened ears.

Zero tapped his comms bead. "Cas. Tell me you got the money shot."

"Got it? I'm minting the 'Kill-Creds' as we speak," Cas’s voice crackled. "But seriously, Zero? A frontal assault? If you die, I’m selling your organs to cover the deductible."

"If that bot was running the new patch, I'd be a smear on the wall," Zero muttered, slapping the cooling catch on his hilt. He knelt by the ruined chassis, his vibro-knife working to pry the glowing fusion cell from its housing. "So, are we rich yet?"

"Solvent for forty-eight hours. Now move, Samurai. The heat just spiked. Viper Squad signature on long-range."

Zero sprinted, the violet afterimage of the kill still burning in his eyes.
