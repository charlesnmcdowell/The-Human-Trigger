# Chapter 1: The Scrapper’s Flow

The Red Thermal Katana hungry-growled against the magnetic lock of the saya. Zero felt the vibration in his molars, a red-hot itch demanding to be scratched. He checked the magnetic alignment on the sheath—0.03 microns off. Good enough for government work, or in this case, stealing from it.

Sector 4 smelled of sulfur and wet rust—the scent of a ship dying slowly. It was an abandoned hydroponics bay, the walls slick with black mold that ate radiation and bled sludge onto the deck plates. Below Zero, the Centurion-class enforcement bot prowled through the overgrown, rotting vines like a metallic panther. A mass of corporate-grey armor and twitchy hydraulics, hunting for anything without a valid ID tag.

Zero checked his thermal readout. **98%.** The plasma edge would burn at 3,000 Kelvin, hot enough to turn durasteel into vapor. The payout wasn't fighting gods; it was the Class-4 Micro-Fusion Cell beating inside the bot’s chest. That fist-sized heart was worth three months of clean air filters and enough bribe money to keep the Void-Sharks off his back. Survival wasn't cheap in the shadow of Jupiter.

His pulse hammered a frantic rhythm against his ribs, drowning out the hum of the recycler vents. The fear sharpened his senses until the world moved in slow motion. In the Scrap-Vats of Europa, the fearless kids were the ones they shoveled into the incinerators. Zero carried their ghosts with him, a silent chorus reminding him that every breath was stolen property.

His hand hovered over the hilt. The trembling came from the memory of Kilo’s laugh and the static burst that silenced it two years ago. He pushed the ghost away. Mourning was a luxury he couldn't afford with a bounty hunter named 'Viper' tracking his heat signature.

*Breathe. Sync. Drop.*

Zero let gravity take the lead.

He hit the deck plates with a magnetic *thud* that shook the dust from the air. The Centurion swiveled instantly, its single optic eye contracting from search-yellow to kill-red.

"Unauthorized bio-sig," the bot’s vocoder buzzed, sounding like a chainsaw hitting a nail.

"Save the sermon for the bandwidth," Zero muttered. Step one: enter the kill-box.

The bot’s Gatling arm spun up—a scream of motors. Zero dropped his center of gravity, boots finding purchase on the oil-slicked floor. He used the heavy, lead-lined sheath as a shield, deflecting the bot's swinging limb with a spark-showering crash. The impact rattled his teeth, jarring his skeleton. *Hydraulics are overclocked.*

"Get off me," Zero grunted.

He twisted his hips, a move from the bilge days. The Centurion matched him, its massive pincer clamping onto his shoulder. Metal groaned against the armor-weave of his kimono.

"You're making this difficult to expense," Zero grit out as pain flared white-hot in his shoulder. He leaned *into* the grip, driving his elbow into the bot's optical sensor with every ounce of kinetic energy he had. Glass shattered. The bot recoiled.

He triggered the release.

*SNAKT.*

The thermal katana cleared the sheath. The air blistered, temperature spiking. The red plasma edge wavered like a heat mirage, a contained error in physics distorting the light.

This was butchery.

Zero drove the blade upward at the heat-sink vent. The blade bit. Metal screamed—a high, wet tearing sound as the thermal edge boiled through the bot’s waist. Hydraulic fluid sprayed like arterial blood, hissing as it hit the hot floor.

Momentum carried him past the ruin. He came up in a crouch, sliding three meters.

The Centurion stood there, optic flickering. The top half slid slowly to the left and hit the floor with the sound of a dumpster falling from orbit.

Silence rushed back into the corridor.

Zero tapped his comms bead. "Cas. Tell me you got the money shot."

"Got it? I'm minting the 'Kill-Creds' as we speak," Cas’s voice crackled. "But seriously, Zero? A frontal assault? If you die, I’m selling your organs to cover the deductible."

"If that bot was running the new patch, I'd be a smear on the wall," Zero muttered, slapping the cooling catch on his hilt. He knelt by the ruined chassis, his vibro-knife working to pry the glowing fusion cell from its housing. Warm, humming with power. "So, are we rich yet?"

"Solvent for forty-eight hours. Now move, Samurai. The heat just spiked. Viper Squad signature on long-range."

Zero sprinted, the red afterimage of the kill still burning in his eyes.
