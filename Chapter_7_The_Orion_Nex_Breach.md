# Chapter 7: The Orion-Nex Breach

"We need supplies," Jax rumbled.

"Orion-Nex," Zero said. "Corporate supply depot. Minimal security."

"Orion-Nex," Jax nodded. "Weak foundations. I welded those beams."

"I can get us in through a vent," Zero said.

Zero crawled through the tight shaft. "I'm in."

He dropped into the warehouse. "Opening bay doors."

Jax loaded crates.

Suddenly, lights out. *// INTRUDER ALERT. //*

**Viper Squad.** Four mercenaries in power armor.

"The Human Trigger," the leader boomed. "Price on your head."

"Jax, load the ship," Zero hissed.

He ignited the katana. The Aces fired. He deflected a bolt and slashed at the leader’s leg. The armor held.

"Refined durasteel," he laughed, backhanding Zero.

Zero hit a crate. Ribs screamed.

"Zero!" Val yelled.

"Cas! Drop the Titan!" Zero screamed.

"You'll depressurize the station!"

"DO IT!"

The ceiling tore open. **Hades dropped.**

Zero scrambled into the cockpit. *// HELLO, ZERO. //*

He punched the leader into the wall. "Leave."

They ran.

We escaped.

"You reckless idiot," Val snapped. "But good catch on the drop."
